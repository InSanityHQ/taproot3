    microscopic spaces capable of soaking up liquids like a sponge.

    may transform into lipids. Apatite has been reported to be capable
    of catalyzing the formation of a proto-lipid [58].

    minerals are deposited on the ocean floor (or dried), the particles
    form a pile, enclosing small spaces (Figure 6). It is conceivable
    that the small spaces behave like cells. Further, when clay minerals
    are dispersed in water, bubbles form in water or the surface of
    water, while the clay particles gather at the boundary between water
    and air, as shown in Figure 7 [57]. In such a case, clay minerals
    make a cell-like spherule.</span></p></li></ul></li></ul><p><span>clay deposits and a type of hydrogel with form sponge like pockets</span></p><p><span>these pockets could have acted as early cells</span></p><p><span>cytoplasm behaves a lot like a hydrogel</span></p><p><span>some of the common minerals found in clay can help the formation of

    into contact with minerals from the planet's crust, reacting to
    create a warm, alkaline (high on the pH scale) environment
    containing hydrogen. The process creates mineral-rich chimneys with
    alkaline and acidic fluids, providing a source of energy that
    facilitates chemical reactions between hydrogen and carbon dioxide
    to form increasingly complex organic compounds.

    needed heat in order to form themselves into a vesicle (protocell).
    An alkaline solution helped the fledgling vesicles keep their
    electric charge. A saltwater environment also proved helpful, as the
    fat molecules banded together more tightly in a salty fluid, forming
    more stable vesicles</span></p></li><li><p><span>The researchers also point out that deep-sea hydrothermal vents are
    not unique to Earth.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Authors of the new theory argue the environmental conditions in
    porous hydrothermal vents --- where heated, mineral-laden seawater
    spews from cracks in the ocean crust --- created a gradient in
    positively charged protons that served as a "battery" to fuel the
    creation of organic molecules and proto-cells. Later, primitive
    cellular pumps gradually evolved the ability to use a different type
    of gradient --- the difference in sodium particles inside and
    outside the cell --- as a battery to power the construction of
    complex molecules like proteins.

    centimeters deep, could have held high concentrations of what many
    scientists believe to be a key ingredient for jump-starting life on
    Earth: nitrogen.
    https://news.mit.edu/2019/earth-earliest-life-ponds-not-oceans-0412</span></p></li><li><p><span>Atmospheric nitrogen consists of two nitrogen molecules, linked via
    a strong triple bond, that can only be broken by an extremely
    energetic event --- namely, lightning. "Lightning is like a really
    intense bomb going off," Ranjan says. "It produces enough energy
    that it breaks that triple bond in our atmospheric nitrogen gas, to
    produce nitrogenous oxides that can then rain down into water
    bodies."</span></p></li><li><p><span>In the ocean, ultraviolet light and dissolved iron would have made
    nitrogenous oxides far less available for synthesizing living
    organisms. In shallow ponds, however, life would have had a better
    chance to take hold. That's mainly because ponds have much less
    volume over which compounds can be diluted. As a result, nitrogenous
    oxides would have built up to much higher concentrations in ponds.</span></p></li><li><p><span>In environments any deeper or larger, nitrogenous oxides would
    simply have been too diluted, precluding any participation in
    origin-of-life chemistry.</span></p></li><li><p><span>[about rna] Having bonded in pairs at low tide, these newly formed
    molecular strands would then dissociate at high tide, when salt
    concentrations were reduced, providing what Lathe terms a
