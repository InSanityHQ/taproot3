    or two? Response: ``` I figured I would write for a few minutes
    before reviewing the site to give you an idea of what content I
    remembered, so here is that: The second law of thermodynamics states
    something along the lines of "entropy increases in a closed system",
    which means that things will generally reach equalibrium, find a
    locally minimal energy state, or remove order. I like to think of it
    as a emergent property of randomness, where atoms/molecules go
    around randomly and in the process undo gradients, etc. Atoms have
    electrons revolving around them, and those electrons stick with the
    nucleus because the core is positively charged. Depending on the
    size and contents of the atom, it might hold onto its outer
    (valence) electrons more strongly than others. This element is said
    to have higher electronegativity. When an atoms bond to form
    molecules, electrons may be transfered (ionic) or they may not. When
    electrons are transfered, each atom/molecule gains an electron which
    changes it's charge. This happens when the electronegativity is very
    high (> 3.4? I don't remember the number). Covalent bonds happen
    when two atoms try to take the same electron, but the difference in
    strength (electroneg) isn't strong enough for one to rip it away. If
    there is a significant difference in strength, you end up with a
    polar covalent bond (delta electroneg >= 0.4?). That means that one
    side of the bond has a partial charge, because the electron spends
    more time on that side of the bond. This is called a dipole, and
    means that the molecule is polar. Polar molecules are hydrophilic,
    which means they tend to interact with water (because water is polar
    and can pull apart polar molecules).</span></p></li></ul></li></ul><p><span>I'm less sure about this stuff: Lipids (like phospholipids which make up
the animal cell walls) are fats, and they are made of carbohydrates?
Carbohydrates are molecules made of carbons and hydrogens. They are not
polar (no polar covalent or ionic bonds) and don't really interact with
water (hydrophobic). Protiens are strings of amino acids, which are
folded by other protiens that float around in the cytoplasm of a cell
based on mRNA?. Protiens do everything in a cell, and their shape is
determined by the polarity of the amino acids that make them up. That's
why protien folding as a computational problem is so important--because
if we can determine the shape of a given amino acid string then we can
design medicine faster (I love this kind of stuff). Enzymes are
catalysts that speed up reactions. I don't remeber how they relate to
other things.</span></p><p><span>Okay, that was 12 minutes. I'll now review the site and note updates
that I would make to the previous brain dump. 1. Nice, she my scale
models in! (Week 3) 2. Enzymes are protiens that help reduce the
activation energy for a reaction, such as by locking the orientation of
the reactants. Enzymes often need to be activated/deactivated and that
happens when other molecules (protiens?) change or block the activation
site. ```</span></p><hr /></section></div></div></article><div class="metapanel"><div class="metalabel">Contents</div><div class="metalabel">Backlinks</div><ul class="firn-backlinks"><li class="firn-backlink"><a href="/biology/bio10/KB20200825142200">Bio</a></li><li class="firn-backlink"><a href="/biology/bio10/KBFreeAssociationBioReviewHuxley">Free Association Bio Review</a></li><li class="firn-backlink"><a href="/biology/bio10/KBe20bio101retIndex">Exr0n's Bio Ret Index</a></li></ul></div></main></body></html>
