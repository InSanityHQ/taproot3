this assessment for the purpose of accessing my class notes and
documents linked on the class Canvas site. I will close all other
internet browser windows before beginning the assessment. I will not use
any other resources, including using search engines to look up terms. I
will not discuss the assessment with anyone but Jehnna, including after
it's completed. If I am confused about wording or terminology used on
the assessment, I will reference the allowed materials and/or ask Jehnna
to clarify by sending a private zoom message to her. I agree that I will
learn best by authentically engaging with the assessment rather than
searching for answers on the internet or from my friends. I understand
that I will be offered a reassessment opportunity if I need it. I affirm
that I, Huxley Marvit, have read this honor code and will abide by it.</span></p><hr /></section><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="1"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>1</span></span></h2><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-5"><h5 class="firn-headline firn-headline-5" id="a"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>A</span></span></h5><section><p><span>mom: pp, dad: PP pP -> P In any combination, their would not be two
