  most of Luke's PCR product was </span><strong><span>single-stranded</span></strong><span> </span><strong><span>rather than

  thermocycling than before). Luke said he got distracted by a classmate
  while setting up the PCR, and might have left out one ingredient.
  *What do you think Luke left out of his PCR reaction and why? Your
  explanation should be linked to the strange results that the teacher
  noticed.**</span></p></blockquote><p><span>Luke most likely left out either his forward primers or reverse primers.
This absence would lead to only one strand being a source of
replication, as only one strand would have the primers. Thus, many
single strands would form as the source of replication would not be able
to be replicated -- only its partner strand would be. Hence, Luke would
end up with mostly single stranded DNA, and less product than expected.</span></p></section></div></div></div></div></article><div class="metapanel"><div class="metalabel">Contents</div><ol><li><a href="#questions">Questions</a><ol><li><a href="#describe-what-is-happening-during-each-cycle-of-the-pcr:">Describe what is happening during each cycle of the PCR:</a><ol><li><a href="#in-one-or-two-sentences-for-each,-explain-why-the-following">In one or two sentences for each, explain why the following</a></li></ol></li><li><a href="#luke-set-up-his-first-pcr-reaction-recently">Luke set up his first PCR reaction recently.</a></li></ol></li></ol><div class="metalabel">Backlinks</div><ul class="firn-backlinks"><li class="firn-backlink"><a href="/biology/bio10/index">Biology Master Index</a></li></ul></div></main></body></html>
