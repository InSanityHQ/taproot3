between science/medicine and ideas about race:</span></strong></p><ol><li><p><strong><span>What resource did you choose and what important ideas did you
   explore that you would hope could be known more widely?</span></strong><span> I chose the
   final Ted Talk, </span><a class="firn-external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOSPNVunyFQ" target="_blank">Skin
   Color is an Illusion</a><span>. It talked about the important ideas
   surrounding different skin colors and their health implications in
   relation to vitamin D.</span></p></li></ol><hr /><ol><li><p><strong><span>What was most surprising or interesting to you in particular and
   why?</span></strong><span> I didn't know Darwin didn't pick up on the connection between
   geography and skin color. I always assumed he had.</span></p></li></ol><hr /><ol><li><p><span>*How should science and/or medicine address their role in
   perpetuating ideas about race and racism? (you can focus on the
   specific issue you explored or think more broadly here). If your
   resource didn't feel focused enough to answer this question, fell
   free to instead tell me more here about what you learned and how it
   connects to the genetics stuff we've been learning in class.* I don't
   view the entirety of </span><code>science</code><span> or </span><code>medicine</code><span> as entities. Science
   cannot act. I would argue instead that </span><code>science</code><span> is a way of viewing
   the world, and perhaps the knowledge collected from this lens. People
   can get it wrong, but the concept of </span><code>science</code><span> or </span><code>medicine</code><span> is not
   the problem. Instead, </span><code>science</code><span> is being wielded poorly. Frankly,
   fundamentally, the problem lies in larger issues and biases. Supposed
   </span><code>science</code><span> has and will continue to be twisted into whatever before
   being presented to the media.</span></p></li></ol></section></div></div></article><div class="metapanel"><div class="metalabel">Contents</div><div class="metalabel">Backlinks</div></div></main></body></html>
