reading 1-8 :: d, c
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>i didn't recognize the contrast. the word in question was referring to
before, not after. this contrast eliminates three answers.</li>
<li>however, i see no evidence for the correct answer.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>#revisit this w/ [cite/t:@selina]</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
lesson: look for the contrast! <b>*</b> reading 1-30 :: d, c
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>i interpreted the data! no. interpretation. remember your training.</li>
<li>stuck between c and d, should have recognized that nothing in c was
wrong, so i was either missing something, or c was the right answer.</li>
</ul>

<p>
lesson: do not interpret. operate at lower level of abstraction! <b>*</b>
reading 1-32 :: d, b
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>answer choice "ruined" implies that it was once good, which there is
no evidence for. everything needs evidence.</li>
<li>this was a "valid in classroom" mistake</li>
</ul>

<p>
lesson: make sure to be clear about the assumptions you are making. <b>*</b>
reading: 1-37 :: c, d
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>the answer i chose had essentially the same meaning as the correct
one, but it wasn't about the future!</li>
<li>i should have recognized that d was also valid. i thought it wasn't
because it had an "unless," but that is countered by the "likely" in
the question above.</li>
</ul>

<p>
lesson: focus on tense. don't be quick to eliminate the answers &#x2013; this
could have been an example of talking myself into the wrong answer. */
reading 1-45, 1-48 :: got these all wrong?? something happened here, ask
about during review. #revisit /* reading 1-51 :: d, a
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>two things i got wrong in this question:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>nothing was actully de-extincted. only, endangered cloned.</li>
<li>de-extinction has not happened yet! so, d does not work.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>fundementally, was not careful enough when thinking about tense,
again!</li>
</ul>

<p>
lesson: consider tense! consider examples more carefully! <b>*</b> writing
2-4 :: d, b
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>no evidence for part of my answer &#x2013; "less engaging"</li>
<li>however, no evidence for tastes changing either? are we supposed to

nc 3-8 :: b, c
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>increasing by $100 per week does not mean every week they increase by
$100. it means, that they increase by $100 once for the remainder of
the time.</li>
<li>i could have found this out if i actully did the math out rigorously,
and realized i was making a mistake as none of the answers matched</li>
<li>in an effort to save time, i did not, and estimated.</li>
</ul>

<p>
lesson: be rigorous! don't get trapped in your own assumptions. <b>*</b> nc
3-9 :: a, b
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>i missed one part of the question, namely x &gt; 0.</li>
<li>remember to actully check all the answers! if i did, i would have
realized that two of them work, and realized my flaw</li>
</ul>

<p>
lesson: check multiple answers, and also look for things you can factor
out / divide! <b>*</b> nc 3-11 :: a, c
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>the equation of a parabola is \(ax^{2}+ bx + c\)!</li>
<li>so if you see a -c term, that means the intercept is at -c, not +c.</li>
</ul>

<p>
lesson: learn the equation for a parabola. goddamn it. <b>*</b> nc 3-15 :: b,
d
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>ran out of time and guessed entirely on this question.</li>

<li>upon doing the question, needed to consider the entire equation. this
made it trivial</li>

<li>found a trap in the question, where one of the answers was the factors
of the right answers. <b>*</b> nc 3-16 :: 8/9, 2</li>

<li>subtracted five from both sides instead of added five to both sides.</li>

<li>i don't know how to prevent this and still have time.</li>
</ul>

<p>
lesson: be careful of dropping signs! <b>*</b> nc 3-17 :: 300, 480
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>i forgot to add the original side length to my answer. I calculated
the unknown side, but then didn't add the known side to it's length to
find the holistic length.</li>
<li>check what the question is actully asking!</li>
<li>especially for these line questions, just db-check which line is
which.</li>
</ul>

<p>
a lot of these wrong answers seem to be intermediate steps. dont get
lost in them!
</p>

<p>
lesson: check what the question is actully asking before writing it
down. make sure to pop back to the question to make sure your not
answering with an intermediate step! <b>*</b> nc 3-19 :: 12, 10
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>i completely guessed on this question. hey, 12 is actully pretty
close!</li>
<li>i should have trusted my instincts and just made the equations, and
see if that worked.</li>
</ul>

<p>
lesson: trust your instincts about systems of equations questions. I got
flustered with this one. <b>*</b> nc 3-20 :: 9/15, 4/5
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>i swapped my sides again!</li>
<li>i mixed up QR for SR.</li>
<li>make sure to db-check sides. that's how they get you.</li>
</ul>

<p>
lesson: check the sides! <b>*</b> c 4-8 :: a, c

</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>i guess i forgot to sqaure my answer for the radius.</li>
<li>intermediate steps again!</li>
</ul>

<p>
lesson: for circle questions, always consider the sqaure of the ending
bit! the constant term will be the sqaure of the radius. <b>*</b> c 4-26 ::
d, b
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>it gave it to me in seconds, and asked about minutes..
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>make sure to pay attention to the units on every single number they
give you!</li>
<li>this would have been obvious if i had realized that the options are
factors of 60.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>if their are factors of 60, or something else, in an answer, then
think about your units and the mistakes they could be causing!
lesson: look out for mismatched units, and be able to spot them
based on common factors in the answer choices. <b>*</b> c 4-30 :: c, b</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>guessed on this question, cus out of time</li>
<li>if they need the x-intercepts to be identified, then that means they
need it in factored form, not in vertex or standard form
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>this instantly elims two of the answers, and we know that the vertex
is on the right side, so the neg on the factor has to be on the
larger number</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
lesson: use the position of the vertex to determine the signs on the
factors <b>*</b> c 4-33 :: 92, 20
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>i dropped a sign.</li>

<li id="#revisit review how to not drop signs! <b>*</b> c 4-36">121, 54-64</li>

\(A=\pi r^{2}* \frac{\theta}{360}\)

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>we know this because area is in square units of length.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
lesson: check the units on the formula to make sure you are using the
right formula <b>*</b> c 4-38 :: 985, 1356
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>this was a hard question.</li>

</ul></li>
<li>advice: be warry that your own thinking can make you read things wrong</li>
</ul>

<p>
lesson: you can read things wrong. that is a real issue. be aware that
this is a failure mode. <b>*</b>

r1 :: d, b
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>i didn't read the passage carefully enough, entirely missing one of
the crucial points.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>i could have found this out if i had been more rigourous with all
the words in my answer choice (ie. rigorous) lesson: consider every
word, and read the frickin passage! <b>*</b> r3,4 :: db, aa</li>
</ul></li>
<li>the trait "unfriendly" does not correspond to losing the friendship of
one person</li>
<li>and plural is not the same as singular?</li>
</ul>

<p>
lesson: #revisit this, idk <b>*</b> r7 :: b, a
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>man. the word "equality" in the description of one relates them all
together. look for the general case!</li>
</ul>

<p>
lesson: when stuck between two choices, with seemingly contradictory
evidence, look for things that generalize. <b>*</b> r11 :: b, a
</p>

<p>
lesson: make <b>sure</b> you are reading the right paragraph. check line
numbers! if a couple of the answers are complete nonsense, then that can
clue you in that you might be in the wrong section. <b>*</b> mnc12 :: b, a
</p>

<p>
i average (2 -4)/2 = -2..
</p>

<p>
lesson: be careful with averages! <b>*</b> mcn13 :: a, b
</p>

<p>
ran out of time here, coudn't find a quick enough way so geussed! could
have done it quickly enough if i had just backsolved.
</p>

<p>
lesson: for complex equations, think about just plugging in something
like x=1 and simplifying! <b>*</b> mcn14 :: b, a
</p>

<p>
again out of time. lesson: remember that you can factor things out of
radicals! <b>/ mcn15 lesson: you can attack larger fractions in your head!
for ratios, think about what /needs</b> to happen for the statement being
asked to be true. */ mnc19 :: a, c got this wrong because i added
instead of subtracted. more specifically, flipped the polarity of sizes
in the units. in the future, lesson: convert between units first! /**
mnc23 sin(a) = cos(b) means that a+b are complementary! so, they =90
remember remember that sin(a) = cos(90-a)!!
</p>

<p>
lesson: whenever you see equated trig functions, replace them with 90-a
to get equalitys! <b>*</b> mnc24 when defining equations, set the vars in
terms of what we know. and a lack of is a negative number
</p>

<p>
when you dont know how to put together a system of euqations, just start
assigning variables! <b>/ mnc30 isolate what we know, and then reflect
convert things to equations &#x2013; "is" equals "=" /</b> ## blb 5 */ c19 :: d,
b i got this wrong because i wasnt sure about 30,60,90 triangles. i
should have checked which sides were which! make sure to check sides.
lesson: match up your sides! know your triangles! /* c26 :: a, b i got
this wrong because i simplified to find a side length instead of the
perimeter. i got too caught up, and didnt think to ask myself again,
"what am i solving for? what do i have?" lesson: ALWAYS ask yourself
what you are <i>actully</i> solving for and also what you got */ c29 :: c, b
i answered the positive instead of the negative! got too tunnel vision
in the graph. lesson: always glance at the other answer choices, or
consider them before you do the question! /* c35 :: 8, 13 tinspire only
gives one set of answers for polynomial with nsolve. instead, use
polyRoots! lesson: if you get an answer that doesnt make sense.. look
again! if you have a sqaured term, then you can get two possible
answers! <b>/ ## blb9 /</b> w7 :: a, d i got this wrong because i didn't know
what i was reading. i didn't understand the difference between lohi and
this new species, which would have made it obvious.
</p>

<p>
lesson: think about what is being referred to, espcially if what looks
like the right answer isnt very strong. <b>*</b> nc6 :: c, b i got this wrong
because i didn't answer the question! i solved for the circumfrance, and
forgot to subtract the original lenght.
</p>

<p>
lesson: espcially for line / geo questions, CHECK WHAT you are ACTULLY
supposed to answer VS what you just solved for before moving on. <b>*</b>
nc111: d, b i got this wrong because i got an answer which worked, and
didnt consider that others could as well. in the future, whenever you
can divide both sides by x, that means that 0 is a solution!
</p>

<p>
lesson: consider the other answers before you submit, especially if they
contain components of the right answer. ** nc15 :: d, b i got this wrong
because i forgot to sqaure my x when i sqaured both sides. also,
<b>radicals are always positive on the sat.</b> this makes sqauring both
sides of an equation <b>not algebraicly sound*</b>
</p>

<p>
lesson: be super careful with sqauring equations and negatives!
remember, radicals are always positive!! if it's simple, just plug and
chug. <b>*</b> c16 :: d,b i got this wrong because i didn't regognize the
different between constants and variables.
</p>

<p>
lesson: if their is an equation with two many things to solve for,
things have to cancel out! look for how to cancel things out. look for
terms that appear on one side but not the other. <b>*</b> c33 :: 10, 8 i got
this wrong because, when finding my probability, i didn't include my
target number in my sample space.
</p>

<p>
lesson: make SURE to think about what your sample space actully is! <b>*</b>
c30: no answer i got this wrong because i wasn't willing enough to
round! remember, always geuss if out of time
</p>

<p>
lesson: be ok with rounding for graph questions. use logic and
estimation over precise solving. <b>/ ## bb10 /</b> c31 :: 3,6 i got this
wrong because i wrote the number i rounded off instead of the right
number.
</p>

<p>
lesson: when you have to round, DOUBLE CHECK after you round. be aware
that you could just be writing the entirely wrong thing. <b>*</b> c30 :: b, a
</p>

<p>
i got this wrong because when i wasnt careful enough about sqauring.
when squaring 2x, it's (2x)<sup>2</sup> = 4x<sup>2</sup>. remember to also sqaure the
coefficient
</p>

<p>
lesson: be careful about sqaured terms. make sure you sqaure
coefficients when nessasarry <b>/ ## bb8 /</b> r9 :: a,c i got this wrong
because i was wrong about the word emphasize. you can emphasize
something that hasn't been said before!
</p>

<p>
lesson: if the right answer doesn't really make sense, <b>really</b> consider
your assumptions. sometimes, words can be used differently. */ w15 :: a,
c i got this wrong because i was too focused on the idea of conscision
and grammar. writing is more than grammar! lesson: conclusions need
transitions! transitioning from previous ideas to new ideas is required.
/* w16 :: b, a i got this wrong because not sound blackbook advice. only
use the who/whom thing when they are explicitly asking you about it! and
use your ear! the reason why the right answer is better is because it
places the subject closer to its pronoun ("both")
</p>

<p>
lesson: trust the ear! think about placement of operators and subjects!
/* w29 :: c, b i got this wrong because i got too caught up in the
sandwiches for em dashes and commas. lesson: if an em dash is an answer,
consider it with the sandwiching rule <b>and</b> on its own! same goes for
commas. */ w35 :: c, d
</p>

<p>
i got this wrong because i ignored the parenthetical phrase. you can't
always do this! the paranthetical phrase made it so that only one answer
was correct, because it was referring to something that needed to be at
the end of the sentence.
</p>

<p>
lesson: consider what concepts need to be at the end and beginning of a
sentence, especially if it doesnt make sense! check out parentheticals
as well <b>*</b> w39 :: c, b
</p>

<p>
dont be so quick to elim things if you don;t know what they are testing
you on! lesson: again, be super warry about what is mentioned at the end
of the previous sentence and the beginning of the next sentence! */ w42
:: b, d i got this wrong because i didn't read the whole sentence.
lesson: make sure to read the whole sentence and listen for if it sounds
right! this way, you can catch tricks! /* nc9 :: c,a was using radius
instead of diameter.
</p>

<p>
lesson: used to working with radius. watch out for diameters! <b>*</b> nc10
:: b, c i got this wrong because i wrote down the number 200 instead of
202!
</p>

<p>
lesson: double check what numbers you are putting down for language
design questions. look at the answers, check what mistakes they could be
looking for. */ nc10 :: 3, 3/2 i got this wrong because i dropped a
sign! lesson: just do out the steps, you have time! be extra careful
about it! plug shit back in to make sure it makes sense <i>* lesson: you
have to divide your variables! *</i> c37 :: 576, 556 i got this wrong
because i trusted graphs not exactly. lesson: look for exact info on
grid in questions, especially if it is given to you! make sure to double
check correspondance of graphs and tables. /*

percents :: i got this wrong because i made an invalid assumption about
other peoples logic. i should have simply double checked.
</p>

<p>
lesson: don't make assumptions about other people logic! just do the
math! <b>/ ## ka writing /</b> transition question : i got this wrong because
i didn't consider the previous sentence and how it connects to the next
sentence closely enough. i also fell for one of the traps: contradicting
info, when the info was different.
</p>

<p>
lesson: for transitions, CONSIDER what the previous sentence "opens" and
the next sentence "receives" also, consider what the info / stats are
actully referring to! <b>*</b>

r28 :: a, b
</p>

<p>
i got this wrong because i didn't look at the things sourounding my
evidence. lesson: context can imply! think about, this but that. <b>*</b> r36
:: a, b i got this wrong because i didn't consider every part of the
question. every word counts! every part needs backing! also, when
struggling, look to the question! see what answers the question more
explicitly.
</p>

<p>
lesson: check every part of the answer. look to the question and see
what addresses it more explicitly if struggling. <b>*</b> r39 :: a, c i got
this wrong because i interpreted the text! something had direct weak
evidence, but evidence nonetheless! no interpretation
</p>

<p>
lesson: don't interpret the text! it's not about the content! it's truly
modernist. <b>*</b> w2 :: b, a i got this wrong because i fucked up affect /
effect.
</p>

<p>
lesson: affect is a verb, but effect is a noun! you can affect
something, or produce an effect. */ nc15 :: c, d i got this wrong
because i didn't follow distribution rules. pay attention to parens! pay
attention to all the different terms, and what mistakes they could cause
you to make! lesson: multiplication distributes! pay atttention to
parens! don't cross shit out! if you think about doing so, make sure
it's validated! things always matter. /* nc20 i got this wrong because i
added to the thousands place instead of the hundreds place. lesson:
write out all of your operations! consider each one! remember, you can
fuck up addition by placement of tens! <b>*</b> c36 :: 31/3, 6 i got this
wrong because i wasn't careful enough about how i was multiplying my
fractions. WRITE IT OUT! also, look for pythagorean triples! if they
give you the ration of a sin function, see if that tells you the side
lenghts!
</p>

<p>
lesson: write out your algebra. be careful with ratios. consider trig
functions as clueing you in on pythagorean triples <b>*</b>

<p>
nc20 :: 1/3, 1/6 i got this wrong because i used \(\pi r^{2}=c\) instead
of \(2 \pi r = c\). always make sure to double check you are using the
right equation! also, inverses of things you are dividing by is simply
1/(whatever you are dividing by). don't confuse yourself.
</p>

<p>
lesson: pause for one second, sanity check the equation you are using.
*/ nc12 :: tip if you see a subtraction, think about making it viable.
ie. multiply the top and bottom to get it to equal the same thing, and
then it should / might fall out. /* nc13 :: tip if an equation has no
real solutions, that means that it never touches the x axis. you can put
it into vertex form and find what needs to happen for the y value to be
appropiate (higher than 0 or lower depending on if the parabola is
facing upwards or downwards). <b>*</b> nc19 :: geuss 2, 1.5 i got this wrong
because i didn't factor in the number i was adding into the divisor for
the average. tip: convert decimals / percentages to numbers! either on
paper or in head.
</p>

<p>
lesson: write it out on paper. percentages of things equaling some other
percentage is just averaging. **/ c31 :: 9, 10 i got this wrong because
i conceptually messed up what it means to <i>increase</i>. if one side of an
equation is greater than the other, and you want to set them equal, then
you have to /subtract* the increase, not add it.
</p>

<p>
this is every evident when you just have an intermediary variable. do
that! lesson: think about that it means to increase! use intermediary
variables! <b>*</b> # To review - polynomial division [ x ] - remainder
