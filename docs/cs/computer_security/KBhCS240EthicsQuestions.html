What, if any, actions
   would you consider unethical? Why? The FBI and teams at Apple had to
   face the choices whether to push an OTA update to the phone of the
   San Bernadino Shooter. When Apple failed to do so, FBI attempted to
   use a third-party service that decrypted the device. Because of the
   court-issued injunction, the FBI was acting within its legal capacity
   to do so. However, Apple made the difficult moral decision in not
   co-operating with the FBI with their investigation. Although I don't
   believe that they were fully in their legal rights to do so, I </span><em><span>do</span></em><span>
   believe their actions were ethical. They did not divert the resources
   to build a back-door to their devices that could be issued via an OTA
   update, which therefore protect future customers from attack.</span></p></li><li><p><span>What, if any, actions in this story do you think should be illegal?
   What actions are actually illegal? Specify laws that might be
   relevant, even if no one was caught or prosecuted. Digital locks, if
   breakable, could be done. The FBI was in their rights to issue an
   injunction, but they should also attempt to seek third-party help
   should they want to break the encryption. For instance, a lock maker
   is not responsible to issue a master key to their lock when the FBI
   could simply break the door.</span></p></li><li><p><span>What things do you think the people involved could have done to
   achieve their goals while staying within legal and ethical bounds? I
   believe that the FBI acted reasonably here: seeking a third-party
   security official to attempt to acquire the decryption key. However,
   Apple should therefore strengthen their security, as that act would
   protect against future attacks by third-parties down the line.</span></p></li><li><p><span>What would you consider appropriate punishment? If relevant to your
   story, how does that compare to the punishments that were handed
   down? There is no punishment that could be issued here. I believe
   that Apple's refusal, although perhaps in-lawful, would be a civil
   and not criminal case. As per aforementioned, though, they should
   attempt to increase the security of their devices in order prevent
   future parties from breaking into their systems.</span></p></li><li><p><span>What are the technical lessons that can be learned to improve
   security? I believe that the security company leveraged three
   zero-days to be able to trigger the decryption mechanism on iPhone
   unlock to bring down full-disk encryption. Because of the fact that
   newer iPhones have e-SIMs, I think it is no longer possible to
   leverage the iMessage bug to introduce the first payload. Also, I
   believe that iMessages are now encrypted now until phone unlock,
   instead of at the moment they were received: protecting against this
   exploit.</span></p></li></ol></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="silk-road"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Silk Road</span></span></h1><section><ol><li><p><span>What are the ethical choices people faced? What, if any, actions
   would you consider unethical? Why? "Force" (Nob) leveraged going
   under undercover to trick individuals to flip for the DEA. I don't
   necessarily believe that this act is </span><em><span>ethical</span></em><span>, but it I nevertheless
   don't believe that he could have done anything different given his
   job as an DEA agent.</span></p></li><li><p><span>What, if any, actions in this story do you think should be illegal?
   What actions are actually illegal? Specify laws that might be
   relevant, even if no one was caught or prosecuted. I think the
   process of working in this is definitely de-jure not illegal, because
   of the fact that there is no laws that would prevent a DEA/FBI agent
   from simply doing their proper job. However, I do believe that parts
   of staging an undercover investigation is quite strange as a behavior
   and should be formally investigated for their legality as it
   nevertheless may trick/put innocent people into crime or otherwise
   exasperate the extent of the crime.</span></p></li><li><p><span>What things do you think the people involved could have done to
   achieve their goals while staying within legal and ethical bounds? I
   believe that the legal bounds were met. However, the bounds of ethics
   is harder to meet here because what they do essentially has to
   include some ethically challenging areas. One potential route may
   include seeking stronger security systems and attempting to passively
   observe and indite the actions instead of attempting to trick those
   into action.</span></p></li><li><p><span>What would you consider appropriate punishment? If relevant to your
   story, how does that compare to the punishments that were handed
   down? The punishment is likely appropriate as handed down: double
   life sentence. However, due to the designation of the owner of the
   website as a "kingpin", he is being held in a maximum security prison
   through it is likely that he had much lower flight risk than others
   in a similar position.</span></p></li><li><p><span>What are the technical lessons that can be learned to improve
   security? Attempt to segregate usernames! It seems like the arrest
   and breakthrough came when his username was digitally linked with
   that of another which eventually lead to a much earlier fourm post
   that contained his email. This was not a breach that needed anything
   but social engineering, which is something that eventually the
   creator of this site fell to.</span></p></li></ol></section></div></div></div></article><div class="metapanel"><div class="metalabel">Contents</div><ol><li><a href="#berdanido">Berdanido</a></li><li><a href="#silk-road">Silk Road</a></li></ol><div class="metalabel">Backlinks</div><ul class="firn-backlinks"><li class="firn-backlink"><a href="/cs/computer_security/index">CS240 Master Index</a></li></ul></div></main></body></html>
