  really only a descretized version</span></p><ul><li><p><span>When there are more people this demand curve grows more continuous
    (is defined at more values of x)</span></p></li></ul></li></ul><blockquote><p><span>  Definition: an </span><strong><span>individual consumer surplus</span></strong><span> is a is how much each

  than their willingness to pay</span></p></li></ul><blockquote><p><span>  Definition: the </span><strong><span>total consumer surplus</span></strong><span> is the sum of all the

  consumer surplus</span></p></li><li><p><span>The integral of the demand schedule represents the </span><strong><span>total consumer
  surplus</span></strong></p></li><li><p><span>A change in price simply means that the delta in total consumer
  surplus is just the integral between two functions</span></p></li><li><p><span>During wartime when low supply goods were sold at original pre-war
  prices, the goverment had to restrict the market even more by making
  people use things like stamps</span></p><ul><li><p><span>This created a whole market for stamps and such but they were only
    purchasing the </span><em><span>right</span></em><span> to purchase that good</span></p><ul><li><p><span>This really becomes the same system where the people who either
      have a lot of utility, or really want something are going to go
      purchase it for more anyways except the extra margins go to the
      black market instead of the producer</span></p></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="producer-surplus-and-the-supply-curve"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Producer Surplus and the Supply Curve</span></span></h2><section><ul><li><p><span>With the producer, you have a similar curve where sometimes the
  producer is simply willing to sell the good for a lower price than it
  was purchased since keeping the good still provides less utility than
  if they were to sell it for a lower price</span></p><ul><li><p><span>In other words, the baseline isn't the purchase price, but the
    seller's lowest selling price (where the seller breaks even with the
    amount of utility they get simply from possessing the item)</span></p></li></ul></li></ul><blockquote><p><span>  Definition: the </span><strong><span>seller's price</span></strong><span> is the lowest a seller is willing to
