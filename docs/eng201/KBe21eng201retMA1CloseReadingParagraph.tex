\begin{quote}
She didn't even trust the twins. She deemed them Capable of Anything. Anything at all. \emph{They might even steal their present back} she thought, and realized with a pang how quickly she had reverted to thinking of them as though they were a single unit once again. After all those years. Determined not to let the past creep up on her, she altered her thought at once. \emph{She. She might steal her present back.}
\end{quote}
