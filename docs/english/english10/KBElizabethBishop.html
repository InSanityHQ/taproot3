and deflated optimism through the vivid, cynical imagery in her poem
"Going to the Bakery." This poem was written during a time of massive
poverty in Brazil, roughly four years after a coup catalyzed massive
changes in monetary policy {citation}. The impact of these policies is
perhaps most clearly referenced when the speaker describes their
currency as "</span><em><span>my</span></em><span> terrific money"{citation}. Notably, this is the only
place throughout the entire poem that the author uses italics for
emphasis. At the time, Brazil was in poverty; distrust towards the
government was rampant. Much like other times of economic and political
turmoil, it was common to use a form of currency not managed by the
legal system, hence Bishop's use of italics: "</span><em><span>my</span></em><span> terrific money"
(citation). Bishop's distrust in the government is also reflected
earlier in the poem, where she describes her surroundings as having "the
iridescence of dying, flaccid, toy balloons" {citation}. Balloons are a
symbol of almost child-like hope -- a promise of joy. Here Bishop
describes them, however, as "dying" and "flaccid," just as the country's
sense of hope deflated while the new government failed to lift them out
of poverty {citation}. Bishop chooses to use toy balloons to represent
optimism, retrospectively calling it childish and naive. The speaker
then enters a bakery, describing "the gooey tarts" as "red and sore,"
the "loaves of bread... like yellow-fever victims laid out in a crowded
ward" (citation). The promise of joy, and therefore hope, inherent in
pastries is not only deflated like the balloons, but also tainted and
repulsive on a visceral level. Hope is an illness; hope is </span><em><span>sickly</span></em><span>.
Ironically, this outlook on hope simply maintains that which causes it;
without hope, one cannot achieve change, making it deadly to require
change to be hopeful.</span></p></section></div></div></div></div></article><div class="metapanel"><div class="metalabel">Contents</div><ol><li><a href="#note-to-alexa:">Note to Alexa:</a></li><li><a href="#\(going\-to\-the\-bakery\)">\(Going\ to\ the\ Bakery\)</a><ol><li><a href="#\(elizabeth\-bishop\)">\(Elizabeth\ Bishop\)</a></li></ol></li><li><a href="#\[writing\-time\]">\[Writing\ Time\]</a><ol><li><a href="#\[:sunglasses:\]">\[:sunglasses:\]</a></li></ol></li></ol><div class="metalabel">Backlinks</div><ul class="firn-backlinks"><li class="firn-backlink"><a href="/english/english10/KBEnglishMasterIndex">English Master Index</a></li><li class="firn-backlink"><a href="/english/english10/index">English Master Index</a></li></ul></div></main></body></html>
