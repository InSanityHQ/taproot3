  be writing on one of the short stories from our packet: "The I is
  Never Alone" or "The Bird-Dreaming Baobab." (For extra challenge, you
  may choose from the Elizabeth Bishop "challenge poems" at the end of
  the packet). Choose an aspect of the short story or poem that will
  enable close reading: a word pattern, a significant image, a literary
  device, a repeated detail, etc. In your topic sentence and paragraph,
  answer the following question: What does this aspect of the text
  reveal about the story/poem's broader themes? This is a broad prompt,
  and I am available to help you narrow it as you begin pre-writing.
  This paragraph assesses the following template items:</span></p><ul><li><p><span>Understanding Literature: Form and Function</span></p></li><li><p><span>Close Reading and Argumentation</span></p></li><li><p><span>Structure and Mechanics</span></p></li><li><p><span>The Writer's Voice</span></p></li></ul><p><span>  </span><strong><span>*</span></strong><span> Important reminders:</span></p><ul><li><p><span>Length: One paragraph, so 250-350 words</span></p></li><li><p><span>Paragraph format: MLA style, double-spaced, 12-point font</span></p></li><li><p><span>In this paragraph, one of your primary goals is to demonstrate your
    close reading skills. Close reading means unpacking the meaning of
    individual words and phrases.</span></p></li><li><p><span>If you write about a pattern/image/etc. that we discussed in class,
    you need to go above and beyond class discussion so that I can see
    your own thinking.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Include page numbers for citations.</span></p></li></ul></blockquote></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="planning"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Planning</span></span></h2><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="text"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Text</span></span></h3><section><p><span>I wanted to use the pronouns based on narrorator vs settlers for the

I noticed that the word "Siriak" appears in differing intensities
throughout the text, and decided to visualize it with a rolling average:

number of references in the surrounding words up to a radius away for
each word in the text. Using a radius of 30 words would result in a
graph as follows:
[[https://github.com/Exr0nRandomProjects/exr0n20eng201retA1analysis/blob/master/process.py]</span><a href="#[https:rawgithubusercontentcomexr0nrandomprojectsexr0n20eng201reta1analysismasterchartpng"></a><span>]]</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="body-points"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Body Points</span></span></h3><section><p><span> The spikes and troughs in the chart align with
moments of reflection and action in the story. For instance, the chart
shows a spike at the beginning of paragraph six--the first time "he
truly understood the depth of his solitude to which he was condemned".
Although Siriak is reflecting upon his own situation where there should
be no need to distinguish between himself and others, over twelve
percent of the nearby words refer to Siriak in second or third
person--from distinctly outside Siriak's inner mind and first person
solitude.</span></p><p><span>The antithesis further reinforces the entanglement of outer pronouns and
inner reflection: in the final third of paragraph seven, the parrots of
the isle begin to repeat Siriak's name. "As one might guess, the outcome
was everything Siriak might have hoped for, if not foreseen." Although
the Siriak's scheming cognition shows through, the author deliberately
minimizes the use of pronouns: Marien picks up the pace of
description--fewer words per action means pronouns can be carried
further and still flow--and uses complex, multi-phrase sentences--the
short, tacked on clauses removes the need for more Siriak-referential
pronouns.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="conclusion"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Conclusion</span></span></h3><section><p><span>Similarly, a spike in pronouns is observed at the end of paragraph
eight, where Siriak has an explicit identity crisis; and a dip in the
middle of paragraph nine, where Siriak turns to the physical outer world
and scatters mirrors about the island. This parity between external
pronouns and internal reflection shows that Siriak's identity is
primarily perceived through the lens of external pronouns, highlighting
the coupled nature of reflection and perception.</span></p></section></div></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="[[https:docsgooglecomdocumentd1x_qqfdp9v5v68n-rq7ruquva-etgttkm1hkb5kgrpuyedit][compiled"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>[[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1x_QqfDP9v5V68n-RQ7RUQuva-EtGtTkm1hkB5KgRpuY/edit][Compiled</span></span></h2><section><p><span>Draft]]</span></p><hr /></section></div></div></div></article><div class="metapanel"><div class="metalabel">Contents</div><ol><li><a href="#assignment">Assignment</a></li><li><a href="#planning">Planning</a><ol><li><a href="#text">Text</a></li><li><a href="#markup">Markup</a></li><li><a href="#thesis">Thesis</a></li><li><a href="#evidence">Evidence</a></li></ol></li><li><a href="#outline">Outline</a><ol><li><a href="#thesis">Thesis</a></li><li><a href="#intro">Intro</a></li><li><a href="#body-points">Body Points</a></li><li><a href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></li></ol></li><li><a href="#[[https:docsgooglecomdocumentd1x_qqfdp9v5v68n-rq7ruquva-etgttkm1hkb5kgrpuyedit][compiled">[[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1x_QqfDP9v5V68n-RQ7RUQuva-EtGtTkm1hkB5KgRpuY/edit][Compiled</a></li></ol><div class="metalabel">Backlinks</div><ul class="firn-backlinks"><li class="firn-backlink"><a href="/english/english10/KBEnglishMasterIndex">English Master Index</a></li><li class="firn-backlink"><a href="/english/english10/index">English Master Index</a></li></ul></div></main></body></html>
