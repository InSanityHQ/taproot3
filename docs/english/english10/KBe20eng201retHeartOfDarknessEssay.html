  thought his memory was like the other memories of the dead that
  accumulate in every man's life---a vague impress on the brain of
  shadows that had fallen on it in their swift and final passage; but
  before the high and ponderous door, between the tall houses of a
  street as still and decorous as a well-kept alley in a cemetery, I had
  a vision of him on the stretcher, opening his mouth voraciously, as if
  to devour all the earth with all its mankind. He lived then before me;
  he lived as much as he had ever lived---a shadow insatiable of
  splendid appearances, of frightful realities; a shadow darker than the
  shadow of the night, and draped nobly in the folds of a gorgeous
  eloquence. The vision seemed to enter the house with me---the
  stretcher, the phantom-bearers, the wild crowd of obedient worshipers
  the gloom of the forests, the glitter of the reach between the murky
  bends, the beat of the drum, regular and muffled like the beating of a
  heart---the heart of a conquering darkness. It was a moment of triumph
  for the wilderness, an invading and vengeful rush which, it seemed to
  me, I would have to keep back alone for the salvation of another soul.
  And the memory of what I had heard him say afar there, with the horned
  shapes stirring at my back, in the glow of fires, within the patient
  woods, those broken phrases came back to me, were heard again in their
  ominous and terrifying simplicity. I remembered his abject pleading,
  his abject threats, the colossal scale of his vile desires, the
  meanness, the torment, the tempestuous anguish of his soul. And later
  on I seemed to see his collected languid manner, when he said one day,
  'This lot of ivory now is really mine. The Company did not pay for it.
  I collected it myself at a very great personal risk. I am afraid they
  will try to claim it as theirs though. H'm. It is a difficult case.
  What do you think I ought to do---resist? Eh? I want no more than
  justice.' ... He wanted no more than justice---no more than justice. I
  rang the bell before a mahogany door on the first floor, and while I
  waited he seemed to stare at me out of the glassy panel---stare with
  that wide and immense stare embracing condemning, loathing all the
  universe. I seemed to hear the whispered cry, 'The horror! The
  horror!"</span></p></li></ul></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="analysis"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Analysis</span></span></h1><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="how-does-it-make-me-feel?"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>How does it make me feel?</span></span></h2><section><ul><li><p><span>The text feels dreamy, abstract, and almost hallucinatory</span></p></li><li><p><span>Kurtz is seen as immortalized, due to his extreme intentions and the

voraciously driven Mr. Kurtz and his death in the pre-colonial Congo. As
Marlow is visiting the late Kurtz's fiance he has a flashback to a
moment in the wilderness: "the stretcher, the phantom-bearers, the wild
crowd of obedient worshipers the gloom of the forests, the glitter of
the reach between the murky bends, the beat of the drum, regular and
muffled like the beating of a heart--the heart of a conquering darkness"
(91). In this excerpt, Conrad uses a three pronged parallel structure of
auditory repetition, logical juxtaposition, and progression of imagery
to illustrate an invading sensory overload. Auditory repetition,
particularly alliteration and consonance, creates a rhythm of language
that drags the reader along. When describing the scene, Marlow intones
"the gloom of the forests, the glitter of the reach". The structural
correspondence of the clauses creates a rhythmic flow and emphasizes the
differing adjectives; the alliterative hard consonant beginnings of each
word also add to the rhythmic feel. This repetitive structure imagines a
relentless march of stimulus flooding Marlow's senses. Marlow also notes
"the wild crowd of obedient worshipers", a lyric whose spate of hard and
soft consonants creates a rhythmic, nearly musical pattern of tension
and release. In "wild" and "crowd", the </span><em><span>w</span></em><span> phonic leads the reader
along to a hard </span><em><span>d</span></em><span> phonic at the end of the word--setting a pace for
the rest of the clause. Then, in "obedient", a string of hard consonants
makes the pronunciation feel fast paced and torrential. The softer
consonants in "worshipers" and the hard </span><em><span>p</span></em><span> near the end creates a quick
trill to end the thought. The staccato repetition of the </span><em><span>d</span></em><span> phonic also
creates a sense of urgency, furthering the avalanche of imagery. As
Marlow speaks in his trance-like state, Conrad uses the juxtaposition of
opposite adjectives to create a sense of paranormality and mystify the
imagery. For example, Marlow mentions "the wild crowd of obedient
worshipers" who are normally obedient but have become rowdy following
Kurtz's departure. Here, the use of contradictory adjectives highlights
the distinction between the mindset and actions of the individual native
and the collected tribe. Similarly, Marlow also speaks of "the glitter
of the reach between the murky bends", whose muddy water can still
reflect the dwindling sunlight at the right angle. This description
separates the beautiful, rippled surface of the river from the imprecise
depths below. Both use contradictory adjectives to create nuance.
Although the their adjectives seem paradoxical at first glance, the
imagery is subtle and sensical. This nuance increases the depth of
imagery and makes the scene more visceral for the reader; the
compactness of the complexity weights each clause and increases the
density of the sensory tsunami. Finally, instead of following a rigid
parallel structure, the imagery in the excerpt increments in scale and
intensity--increasing the sense uncontrollable expanding cognizance.
Marlow focuses first on stretcher, then the bearers, then the forest and
the river, and finally the oppressive drums and inner continent itself.
As each piece of imagery engulfs the previous, the reader imagines the
situation in a broader and broader context--as if through the viewfinder
of a camera, zooming out into space. It is as if Marlow is bringing us
along for a non-lucid out of body experience. Not only does the object
of focus become physically larger, but the nuance of description also
increases. At first, Kurtz's stretcher is simply a stretcher--but as the
vision goes on the forest is "gloomy" and the water glitters in a
specific reach between the bends. This culminates in the description of
the beating of a drum: "regular and muffled like the beating of a
heart--the heart of a conquering darkness". Not only does Conrad use an
entire simile and an em-dash, but he also ties it back to the title and
thus the entire progression of the story. This zoom-out reveals the
structure of the plot--the lay of the land, so to speak. This vision is
a defining moment of Marlow's life flashing before his eyes, the epitome
of sensory overload. Each aspect of Marlow's vision conveys a feeling of
being overwhelmed. The intensity of the vision and it's freshness in his
memory creates a sensory overload conveyed to the reader through
phonetics, language, and content.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="editing"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Editing</span></span></h1><section><ul><li><p><span>No 1st or 2nd person</span></p></li><li><p><span>No colloquial/slang</span></p></li><li><p><span>Precise language</span></p></li><li><p><span>No "big, good, bad, thing, get, interesting, really"</span></p></li></ul></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="feedback-round-1"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Feedback round 1</span></span></h1><section><ul><li><p><span>Intro could be longer (because so much of it is a quote)</span></p></li><li><p><span>Thesis</span></p><ul><li><p><span>missing a so what</span></p></li><li><p><span>what does the intensity of the congo show?</span></p></li><li><p><span>connect to the meaning and intentions behind the novel</span></p></li></ul></li></ul></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="export"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Export</span></span></h1><section><p><span>https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j8QsHTNkcqGl8mAIR5ddp1CdKODspltTYg2Eaf-H0MA/edit</span></p><hr /></section></div></div></div></article><div class="metapanel"><div class="metalabel">Contents</div><ol><li><a href="#prompt">Prompt</a></li><li><a href="#evidence">Evidence</a></li><li><a href="#analysis">Analysis</a><ol><li><a href="#how-does-it-make-me-feel?">How does it make me feel?</a></li><li><a href="#literary-devices">Literary Devices</a></li></ol></li><li><a href="#thesis">Thesis</a></li><li><a href="#outline">Outline</a><ol><li><a href="#intro">Intro</a></li><li><a href="#body-1">Body 1</a></li><li><a href="#body-2">Body 2</a></li><li><a href="#body-3">Body 3</a></li><li><a href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></li></ol></li><li><a href="#essay">Essay</a></li><li><a href="#editing">Editing</a></li><li><a href="#feedback-round-1">Feedback round 1</a></li><li><a href="#export">Export</a></li></ol><div class="metalabel">Backlinks</div><ul class="firn-backlinks"><li class="firn-backlink"><a href="/english/english10/KBEnglishMasterIndex">English Master Index</a></li><li class="firn-backlink"><a href="/english/english10/index">English Master Index</a></li></ul></div></main></body></html>
