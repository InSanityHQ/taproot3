Things</span></em><span> for your in-class close reading writing. Be sure to examine the
specific denotation and connotations of Roy's language.</span></p><p><span>Reading, the double entendre. "Study (an academic subject) at a
university." (OED, AA) However, in this passage, there's also
"understand or interpret the nature or significance of." (OED, AB).</span></p><p><span>Come down --- a sense of superority --- a sense of criticism w.r.t.
Chacko has a sense of superority. Chaco's aeromodeling kit kept
crashing, shows dichotomy between reality and fiction.</span></p><p><span>Chacko's airplones, kits --- arranged --- that he always messes up.
Similar to his running of the factory. Prearranged systems that he
messes up.</span></p><p><span>Effect of sarcasm: famous. </span><em><span>Is famous sacrasm??</span></em></p><p><span>The sense of British superority used against him. Infatuation with
titles.</span></p><ol><li><p><span>Infatuation with titles and male chavinism</span></p></li></ol><p><span>You don't go to oxford, you "understand" at oxford. And after you
understand at oxford, you rid yourself of your corrupt ways. One does
not simply head to oxford, one attempts to see and understand (Luke
19:5), and Come Down to rid of sins.</span></p><p><span>Inherent sense of superority, for Chacko, Oxford is the tree that allows
him to see Jesus. Marxist.</span></p><p><span>Ammu instead offers an alternate interpretation, instead of meeting a
Jesus like figure, one actually meets a harsher figure: the ground. One
acutally comes down to earth, and, instead of seeing Jesus and achiving
salvation, chacko bites the dirt.... by destroying prebuilt systems.</span></p><p><span>Unexpected use of famous --- well known, but not because they were good
but instead because of they were expressly terriable --- offers sharp
dichotomy like that offered by Ammu before.</span></p><p><span>Highlights the contrasting nature of the sibling dynamic.</span></p><p><span>Sad --- a powerless word --- highlights Ammu's lack of control over
Chacko's falling plane. Because male superority. Because she does not
have control, she could only observe and pity.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="claim"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Claim</span></span></h2><section><p><span>So three things</span></p><p><span>1) Chacko derives a sense of superiority at Oxford --- believing that it
   grants him access to a hightened understading and be "saved"</span></p><ul><li><p><span>He does not simply read at harvard, he "reads" --- attempting to
     "understand/interpreate the nature" of things at Oxford.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Then, after he "understands", he "comes down". This is reminiscent
     as KJV Luke 19:4-5, when the greedy tax collector Zacchaeus of
     Jericho climbed up a tree to see Jesus --- "to understand ... the
     nature", and then got asked to "come down" b/c Jesus wants to go to
     his house.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Chacko expected that Oxford the tree allowed him to "come down" and
     be "saved" perhaps from his current station (future land lord, not
     unlike Zaccheaus). However, his sister offers a different
     interpretation:</span></p></li></ul><p><span>2) Instead, his sister contradicts him, stating that he instead comes
   "down to earth" and, instead of being saved by his Oxford education,
   simply bites the dirt</span></p><ul><li><p><span>His family's pickle factory became unprofitable after Chacko took
     over --- just like his fallen airplanes, which are boxed sets
     already setup for him only for him to incorrectly assemble and
     crash due to the discord that exists between his supposed newfound
     hightened understanding and his actual management abilitiy.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Ammu remarks that the airplanes are "famous" --- really infamous.
     Although not a strict verbal irony, Ammu uses the the term because
     it is opposite the tipical connotation. Chacko's airplanes are
     famous not for a positive quality but instead for its ease of
     failure. Elongating the previous metaphore, this forshadows a
     potential, infamous failure for Paradise pickles</span></p></li></ul><p><span>3) Remarking upon all of this, Ammu is "sad"</span></p><ul><li><p><span>Sadness is quite a passive emotion --- she is unappy, and
     regretful, but due to the "male chavunist nature" of society he is
     unable to act</span></p></li><li><p><span>Ammu slightly laments her station in life this way, hinting that
     she could actually see the problem clearer than Chacko as his
     failure is "predictable"</span></p></li></ul><p><span>*In the passage selected in the GOST, Roy leverages biblical illusions,
creative word choices, and entended metaphores to highlight Ammu's
conflict with the 'male chauvinist' superiority exhibited by Chaco and
leverages this conflict to forshadow the eventual downfall of their
family business.*</span></p><p><em><span>Copy and paste the passage to the top of the essay!!</span></em></p><hr /><p><span>There is always</span><a class="firn-external" href="https://wp.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/UWC_handouts_What-How-So-What-Thesis-revised-5-4-15-RZ.pdf" target="_blank">UCLA
