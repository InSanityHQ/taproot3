repetition of some type in the text, including but not limited to
repetitions in diction, images, structure, syntax, or characters'

  the egg whites from nearly nine hundred eggs went into it. It took a
  high polish." CF</span></p></li><li><p><span>(Eggs) "War could have been the stallion that he rode, part of, if not
  all, the way to the Legislative Assembly, whereas victory left him no
  better off than when he started out. He broke the eggs but burned the
  omelette." CG</span></p></li><li><p><span>(Bubbles) "Rahel ignored her and blew an inadvertent spit bubble. Ammu
  hated them blowing spit bubbles. She said it reminded her of Babà.
  Their father. She said that he used to blow spit bubbles and shiver
  his leg. According to Ammu, only clerks behaved like that, not
  aristocrats." CH</span></p></li><li><p><span>(Bubbles) "Blowing through the straw (while his other hand moved),
  Estha blew bubbles into the bottle. Stickysweet lemon bubbles of the
  drink he couldn't drink." CI</span></p></li><li><p><span>(Bubbles) "So once again, in the space of two weeks, bottled Fear for
  Estha. Chilled. Fizzed. Sometimes Things went worse with Coke. The

  straw till the drink bubbled over onto her dress. All over the floor."
