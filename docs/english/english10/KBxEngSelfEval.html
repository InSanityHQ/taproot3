How have you grown as
  a writer?</span></p><ul><li><p><span>I've gained a lot of tacit knowledge about writing; I feel as if
    there is less of a barrier between my thoughts and the words on the
    (digital) paper.</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><span>Describe your writing process and how it has evolved over the
  semester?</span></p><ul><li><p><span>For most work in English class, I generally start just by thinking
    for a while. I create quite extensive outlines, starting with fluid
    and undeveloped ideas; through research and more thinking, I move to
    an outline describing my idea flow. I gather a "Quote Bin"
    containing evidence, and begin writing. Throughout the course of the
    semester, the time spent writing has shrank relative to the time
    spent outlining.</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><span>Describe the progress you've made in your ability to understand a
  text, to identify important moments, to annotate them, and to create
  good questions to bring to class?</span></p><ul><li><p><span>This semester, I've tried to move from close reading to derive
    possible meanings to close reading to understand the broader
    concepts of the text. I have tried to not close read simply for the
    sake of close reading, but rather to use close reading as a tool for
    understanding the text at a broader level. This philosophy has
    helped me do all the skills listed above.</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><span>What aspect of your performance in English class are you most proud
  about this semester (writing process, discussion skills, close
  reading, a specific assignment)?</span></p><ul><li><p><span>When in quarantine this long, it's hard not to just let the days
    slip by without really experiencing or engaging in them. While it
    sounds mundane, I'm proud of being mentally present to every English
    class, and never just "sitting through" them.</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><span>What are your goals in English for next semester? Set at least two
  specific goals and describe how you will meet them.</span></p><ul><li><p><span>I've been getting a lot of value out of group projects, just having
    people to bounce ideas off of and learn from. This type of
    interaction is much more limited nowadays; next semester, I would
    like to engage in more of them.</span></p></li><li><p><span>For writing pieces, I often entirely change what I am writing about
    multiple times because I'm not happy with the ideas in them. I end
    up scrapping a lot of work and a lot of time. Next semester, I would
    like to reduce this work and time lost.</span></p></li></ul></li></ul></section></div></div></article><div class="metapanel"><div class="metalabel">Contents</div><div class="metalabel">Backlinks</div><ul class="firn-backlinks"><li class="firn-backlink"><a href="/english/english10/KBEnglishMasterIndex">English Master Index</a></li><li class="firn-backlink"><a href="/english/english10/index">English Master Index</a></li></ul></div></main></body></html>
