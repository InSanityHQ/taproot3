her sunglasses to get a better look at the dead frog squashed on the

I made my model as close as possible to how Rahel's watch is described
in the novel, from the toy-like shoddy manufacturing to the painted on
hands. These hands are placed at ten to two, a phrased frequently
repeated throughout the entire novel. Of course, a watch with painted on
hands defeats the very purpose of a watch; after all, how can it tell
the time if it never changes? Rahel wants to "own a watch on which she
could change the time whenever she wanted to (which according to her was
what Time was meant for in the first place)." (citation). Arundhati Roy,
the author of the book and the constructor of its world, does just this.
The story is told non-linearly; the laws of Time are changed and broken
constantly, whenever Roy wants to. The passage of time becomes almost
meaningless, as the story is not about chronology. The phrase repeated,
"it was ten to two,"(citation) is not ten before two, ten till two, or
even 1:50. Instead, it is deliberately chosen to be "ten to two," which
could easily be misinterpreted as ten two two. But it doesn't matter,
and that's the point. Frozen time is practically an oxymoron; time has
become meaningless. Furthermore, the book reads "it was," asserting that
the watch is correct about the time, which of course, it isn't. Time has
become frozen, and thus, in the classical sense of the word, becomes
meaningless, arbitrary, and changeable. But this begs the question, what
does frozen time mean?</span></p><p><span>Frozen time can take primarily two meanings, both of which appear in the
book. The first meaning is that time simply does not pass, or in
practice, does not create change. I represented this with the unchanging
watch in the center of the frame, where even "under twenty-three years
of June rain," Rahel's "plastic wristwatch with the time painted on it
[...] stays buried. [...] Ten to two it said." (citation). The passage
of time fails to change the positions of the hands, just as it fails to
change much else in the book. Immutable or unchanging things are, in a
sense, frozen in time. This theme of immutability appears often
throughout the book, perhaps most apparently with the caste system.
Despite Velutha's infinite kindness, he is still beaten to death. Even
the communist party, described as "a cocktail revolution," is prejudiced
against low class members. (citation) Even when the ideology directly
contradicts it, the caste system is still unchanged; it is frozen in
time. This theme appears again with Baby Kochamma's love for Father
Mulligan, when even "Father Mulligan's death did not alter the text of
the entries in Baby Kochamma's diary," all declaring her love
(citation). The theme even sneaks into smaller instances, such as
Mammachi's inability to stop her pickle jars from leaking leaves her
wondering "whether she would ever master the art of perfect
preservation" for her entire life (citation).</span></p><p><span>The second way time can be frozen is best demonstrated by a quote from
William Faulkner: "The past is never dead. It's not even past." The past
stays with us in the sense that we can never escape its effects. I chose
to represent this with the grass growing. The world is not frozen, time
still passes, and yet, the watch remains; untouched, trapped. This sense
of frozen time also appears throughout the book. The phrase "ten to two"
only ever appears when Rahel is waiting. The very first use of the
phrase appears while in the train station: "The Waiting filled Rahel
until she was ready to burst. She looked at her watch. It was ten to
two." (citation). When one is waiting, they are acutely aware of the
time. Time is passing, and yet it remains ten to two. The one time the
phrase appears when Rahel is not waiting is when the watch is left at
the History House. History itself is about the past and its impacts,
ones we can never escape. Estha becomes mute because of his trauma,
unable to escape the past. Chacko cannot escape his marriage, still
trapped in a unofficial one sided relationship. Margaret Kochamma cannot
escape Sophie Mol's death. After all, things can change forever in a
day.</span></p><p><span>Once the quietness arrived, it stayed and spread in</span></p><p><span>Estha.</span></p><p><span>Wether it's waiting for a train,</span></p></section></div></div></div></article><div class="metapanel"><div class="metalabel">Contents</div><ol><li><a href="#apearence:">apearence:</a></li><li><a href="#qoute-bin:">qoute bin:</a></li><li><a href="#analysis:">analysis:</a></li><li><a href="#here-we-are,-outlining">here we are, outlining.</a></li><li><a href="#batman-begins">batman begins.</a></li></ol><div class="metalabel">Backlinks</div><ul class="firn-backlinks"><li class="firn-backlink"><a href="/english/english10/KBEnglishMasterIndex">English Master Index</a></li><li class="firn-backlink"><a href="/english/english10/index">English Master Index</a></li></ul></div></main></body></html>
