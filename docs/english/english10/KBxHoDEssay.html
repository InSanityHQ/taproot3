    I don't know what else, burst into a blaze so suddenly that you
    would have thought the earth had opened to let an avenging fire
    consume all that trash. I was smoking my pipe quietly by my
    dismantled steamer, and saw them all cutting capers in the light,
    with their arms lifted high, when the stout man with moustaches came
    tearing down to the river, a tin pail in his hand, assured me that
    everybody was 'behaving splendidly, splendidly,' dipped about a
    quart of water and tore back again. /I noticed there was a hole in
    the bottom of his pail./"</span></p></li><li><p><span>"I strolled up. There was no hurry. You see the thing had gone off
    like a box of matches. It had been hopeless from the very first. The
    flame had leaped high, driven everybody back, lighted up
    everything---and collapsed. The shed was already a heap of embers
    glowing fiercely. A n[word] was being beaten near by. They said he
    had caused the fire in some way;"</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><span>blindfold with torch</span></p><ul><li><p><span>“Then I noticed a small sketch in oils, on a panel, representing a

    an empty half-pint champagne bottle (medical comforts) with the

    There wasn't even a shed there, and she was shelling the bush. It
    appears the French had one of their wars going on thereabouts. Her
    ensign dropped limp like a rag; the muzzles of the long six-inch
    guns stuck out all over the low hull; the greasy, slimy swell swung
    her up lazily and let her down, swaying her thin masts. In the empty
    immensity of earth, sky, and water, there she was, incomprehensible,
    firing into a continent. Pop, would go one of the six-inch guns; a
    small flame would dart and vanish, a little white smoke would
    disappear, a tiny projectile would give a feeble screech---and
    nothing happened. Nothing could happen. There was a touch of
    insanity in the proceeding, a sense of lugubrious drollery in the
    sight; and it was not dissipated by somebody on board assuring me
    earnestly there was a camp of natives---he called them
    enemies!---hidden out of sight somewhere."</span></p></li></ul></li></ul></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="let&apos;s-outline,-shall-we?"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Let's outline, shall we?</span></span></h2><section><p><span>TODO: change "idea" to something like "form over content" TODO: change

goal requires process. In fact, that's what processes are for. In Heart
of Darkness, Conrad explores the madness that occurs when processes
become ends in themselves - disconnected from the ideas and goals they
are intended to serve. This disconnection is inherent in colonialism,
where the goal is to transplant ideas - in this case, ways of doing
things and even ways of being - to unsuitable contexts. Conrad
repeatedly demonstrates that when processes are taken out of context,
they lead to absurd behaviors and outcomes - the very definition of
irony. In Heart of Darkness, he repeatedly uses ironic imagery of
decontextualized processes to warn the reader of the dangers they
create.</span></p><p><span>Through ironic imagery of a bucket, Conrad shows the danger of using
processes in the absence of context. Marlow describes one of the
evenings on his journey, in which a massive fire suddenly "burst into a
blaze" (citation). He details how a "stout man with moustaches came
tearing down to the river, a tin pail in his hand, assured me that
everybody was 'behaving splendidly, splendidly,' dipped about a quart of
water and tore back again. I noticed there was a hole in the bottom of
his pail" (citation). Of course, this man isn't truly helping put out
the fire -- after all, there is a hole in his bucket. Instead, he is
engaging mindlessly in the process of putting out a fire. The actual
reality of the fire is entirely irrelevant. The "stout man" is not
incorrect when he describes the situation as going "splendidly," because
splendid is defined as following the process. The actual state of
reality has no bearing upon whether or not something is going
"splendidly." This instance is the second time where this man has said
this line; in response to hearing that Marlow's steamer had sank, he
says his signature line then insists in agitation that Marlow must
follow the process and go "see the general manager at once" (citation).
This exact repetition of phrase------"splendidly, splendidly"------only
goes to show the man's further detachment from reality and adherence to
process. Marlow then goes on to describe that "A n[word] was being
beaten near by. They said he had caused the fire in some way;"
(citation). This situation is a microcosm of colonialism as a whole, in
which processes applied without context by the colonizer leads to the
hurt and exploitation of the colonized------justified under the guise of
a savior.</span></p><p><span>This concept does not only apply to singular people, but to larger
institutions and systems as well. Marlow notes that sometimes he gets
"momentary contact with reality." However, these were fleeting, as
"something would turn up to scare it away" (citation). He goes on to
describe one such thing, and speaks of a warship "In the empty immensity
of earth, sky, and water, there she was, incomprehensible, firing into a
continent" (citation). This warship resides in the "empty immensity,"
where, of course, there is nothing to fire at; the warship fires
anyways. Marlow goes on to describe the ships firing with words like
"feeble," "tiny," and "little," finishing by saying that "nothing
happened. Nothing could happen" (citation). The warship and the many who
keep it running are, in Marlow's words, "scar[ing] away" his contact
with reality. Not only is engaging in processes without context
supported by systems, but it is actively spread by them. When one lives
in a reality surrounded by those who do not, coexistence requires some
sort of conformity. When one does not live in reality, the processes
they partake in are unfalsifiable. This deadly combination is what
allows systems like these to spread so effectively, and what "scare[s]
away" Marlow's connection with reality. The members of the crew justify
their firing, claiming that there are enemies "hidden out of sight
somewhere" (citation). This justification could be confused with needing
ties with reality, and hence, the distinction between justification and
connection to reality must be drawn. Of course, there are no enemies.
This lack of need is what allows the firing to be "feeble." The fact
that there are no enemies is irrelevant. The justification has no ties
in reality, and its content is arbitrary. All that matters is that some
justification exists. This lack of connection to reality and ease of
spread contributes to the danger of engaging in processes without
context.</span></p><p><span>Conrad's ironic imagery of a torch serves as a metaphor for the
colonists, showing the effects of partaking in mindless processes.
Marlow notices a painting which he describes as "a small sketch in oils,
on a panel, representing a woman, draped and blindfolded, carrying a
lighted torch."(citation?) The juxtaposition and irony of a blindfolded
woman carrying a torch is immediately evident. Of course, a torch is
useless when blinded, just as a bucket is useless when it can't hold
water------both examples of following processes without the context of
reality. Marlow goes on to describe that "the background was
sombre---almost black. The movement of the woman was stately, and the
effect of the torchlight on the face was sinister." The use of the word
stately to describe the woman clearly eludes that she is meant to
represent the state. With this information, it can be inferred that the
torch represents that which the state------or more specifically, the
colonists------are bringing to the colonized. Not only are the colonists
blinded to what they are truly doing to the natives, but they are
blinded to what they are doing to themselves. Marlow describes the
"effect of the torchlight on the face" as sinister. Marlow is referring
specifically to "the face;" not the surroundings, and not </span><em><span>her</span></em><span> face.
The effect of the torchlight applies only to "the face," as the
background is "almost black." This specific verbiage shows how the
colonists are themselves becoming sinister, being made sinister by what
they bring to the natives. The use of the word "the" instead of </span><em><span>she</span></em><span> is
meant to generalize the statement. Another important distinction is that
the torch is not revealing the colonists to be sinister, but making them
so, hence the use of the word "effect." Not only is the torch futile and
useless as with the bucket, but it is actively making those who partake
in processes detached from reality------in this case,
colonialism------sinister.</span></p><p><span>These examples illustrate the effects of decontextualized processes.
They are useless in achieving the goals they are intended to, they lead
to violence, they are supported and propagated by systems and
institutions, and they make those who partake in them sinister. We would
like to think that we have overcome the horror present in colonialism,
that it is only something we read about in school. The truth is, the
root of colonialism -- what caused it to become so evil -- is not only
present in colonialism, but present in so much today. Processes
disconnected from reality is what allows institutions and systems to act
without morality or concern for reality, what allows systemic problems
to come into play, and what can turn even the kind hearted evil. The
best way to overcome these problems, is to first understand their root,
to re-attach these processes to reality.</span></p></section></div></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="[[https:docsgooglecomdocumentd1onr1cqqjfge81savbogqp7yogzcgorwpq-6yipkdteeedit?usp=sharing][final"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>[[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1onR1CQQjFge81saVBogQp7YOgZCGOrWpQ-6YIPkDTeE/edit?usp=sharing][Final</span></span></h1><section><p><span>Version]]</span></p></section></div></div></div></article><div class="metapanel"><div class="metalabel">Contents</div><ol><li><a href="#this-is-fun!(?)">This is fun!(?)</a><ol><li><a href="#prompt">Prompt</a></li><li><a href="#wait,-thesis-is-due-thursday?">Wait, thesis is due Thursday?</a><ol><li><a href="#thesis:-conrad-uses-ironic-imagery-in-the-heart-of-darkness-to">Thesis: Conrad uses ironic imagery in the Heart of Darkness to</a></li></ol></li></ol></li><li><a href="#writing-thyme-:sunglasses:-(?)">Writing Thyme :sunglasses: (?)</a><ol><li><a href="#unedited-version">UNEDITED VERSION</a></li></ol></li><li><a href="#[[https:docsgooglecomdocumentd1onr1cqqjfge81savbogqp7yogzcgorwpq-6yipkdteeedit?usp=sharing][final">[[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1onR1CQQjFge81saVBogQp7YOgZCGOrWpQ-6YIPkDTeE/edit?usp=sharing][Final</a></li></ol><div class="metalabel">Backlinks</div><ul class="firn-backlinks"><li class="firn-backlink"><a href="/english/english10/KBEnglishMasterIndex">English Master Index</a></li><li class="firn-backlink"><a href="/english/english10/index">English Master Index</a></li></ul></div></main></body></html>
