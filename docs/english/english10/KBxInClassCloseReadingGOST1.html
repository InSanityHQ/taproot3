points. It represents a plethora of conversations, all condensed into
just a few bullet points: "a)" and "b)". Condensing these conversations
into so few bullets points, clearly defined down to the individual word
level, not only represents the characters more broadly but shows also
shows the lack of change in the characters involved. Chacko begins by
drawing a dichotomy: "a) You don't </span><em><span>go</span></em><span> to Oxford. You </span><em><span>read</span></em><span> at
Oxford." Chacko's usage of the word "/read/" removes Oxford from the
world of the physical and moves it into the world of the intellectual;
in Chacko's mind, Oxford is not defined as merely a place. This
sentiment is also conveyed in Chacko's second and last point: "b) After</span><em><span>reading</span></em><span> at Oxford, you /come down./" Oxford is not equal to the rest
of the world, but rather something heavenly. By saying that one "/comes
down/" from Oxford, it raises Oxford up. It places Oxford higher in the
hierarchy, and in turn, places Chacko's current state lower. Ammu
responds, "Down to earth, d'you mean?" She is depicted as using the word
"d'you", starkly contrasting Chacko's style of speech --- placing
emphasis and importance on single words: "</span><em><span>go</span></em><span>, and"/read/‚Äù. "[D]'you"
is not elitist and not proper, and yet Ammu still overcomes Chacko in
conversation: she continues, "</span><em><span>That</span></em><span> you definitely do. Like your famous
airplanes." The airplanes Ammu refers to are airplane kits which
regularly arrive for Chacko. Ammu states "that the sad but entirely
predictable fate of Chacko's airplanes was an impartial measure of his
abilities." Chacko painstakingly assembles them, time after time, and
when they inevitably crash, he never blames the kits. These kits
represent a promise. A promise that, if one puts in the work to assemble
them, they will succeed --- the plane will soar high. If it doesn't,
then the failure falls on the maker, not the kit. This promise, of
course, is a false promise. No matter what Chacko does, he will never be
able to stay aloft, hence why the fate of the planes is "entirely
predictable." Furthermore, kits are a mockup, not the real thing. These
kits are akin to Chacko's experience with Oxford --- the false promise
of being able to soar high if only one puts in the work. But alas,
Chacko's planes inevitably crash. He never receives the access to
privilege and the elite that he is promised, the ability to soar high
like an airplane. Instead, he crashes "down to earth" over and over
again. Ammu states a contradiction, that the "entirely predictable fate"
of Chacko's airplanes are an "an impartial measure of his abilities." If
the fate is </span><em><span>entirely</span></em><span> predictable, how can it be an impartial measure?
Out of this contradiction arises meaning. The kits will inevitably fail,
no matter what Chacko does. He is in a biased environment, one that is a
mockup of the real thing, one where he cannot succeed. The true measure
of Chacko's ability arises from the fact that he doesn't recognize his
own futility in engaging in this clearly biased system, these clearly
flawed kits.</span></p></section></div></div></div></div></article><div class="metapanel"><div class="metalabel">Contents</div><ol><li><a href="#&apos;in-class&apos;-close-reading">'in class' close reading.</a><ol><li><a href="#outlining">Outlining</a></li><li><a href="#writing-time">Writing time</a></li></ol></li></ol><div class="metalabel">Backlinks</div><ul class="firn-backlinks"><li class="firn-backlink"><a href="/english/english10/KBEnglishMasterIndex">English Master Index</a></li><li class="firn-backlink"><a href="/english/english10/index">English Master Index</a></li></ul></div></main></body></html>
