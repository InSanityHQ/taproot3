<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-essay-2nd-draft">
<pre class="example" id="orga843cd7">
In his breakout novel There There, Orange tackles the question of what it means to be Native American in modern times while exploring the many problems that are present in urban Native American communities. This is done primarily through exploring the modern Native American experience of 10 Native Americans centered around the Oakland Powwow. In particular, Orange focuses on Tony, a young man who grapples with his identity as an Urban Indian. Tony's exploration of his Urban Indian identity is characterized by a conscious rejection of his Indian heritage, which is contrasted by an subconscious embracement of his ancestory.
The concept of the "Urban Indian" is a recurring and central theme throughout There There. Orange defines Urban Indians as being "the generation [of Native Americans] born in the city" (11), the descendents of the Native Americans who relocated to cities because of the Indian Relocation Act. Urban Indians grow up in the city, surrounded by the city, and as such, "belong to the city" (11) rather than to the reservations their ancestors came from. As a consequence of being formed as a Native American identity formed in cities, the Urban Indian identity is closely related to both Native American identity and urban identity, but it is not accurate to condense the Urban Indian identity as merely a synthesis of those two identities; Much like how African American identity is reflective of the many  hardships African Americans faced, Urban Indian identity is also tied heavily to the unique hardships Native Americans faced while navigating their urban environments.
No character's identity reflects this aspect of Urban Indian identity more than that of Tony. Tony's mother suffered with alcoholism, a problem widespread in urban Indian communities. As a result of her alcoholism, Tony was born with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, which he refers to as the "Drome" (15). Although Tony credits the Drome for his street smarts, he also admits that the Drome also created many hardships for him, from making him "fail...the intelligence test" (16) to making him "look...like a monster" (19).
Tony's identity as an Urban Indian is closely tied to his perception of the Drome. Tony claims that "[t]he Drome is my mom and why she drank, it's the way history lands on a face, and all the ways I made it so far despite how it has fucked with me" (16). This passage is insightful in analyzing Tony's perception of his Urban Indian identity, in that it indicates that Tony views the Drome not only as a physical hardship that he has had to overcome over the years, but also as a metaphor for the burden of his ancestors' history that he has had to carry as an Urban Indian. When Tony claims that "people look at [him] and then look away when they see [him] see them see [him]" (16), he means that people look away both because of his appearance and because of the many negative stereotypes of Urban Indians. By viewing the "Drome" as a metaphor, it becomes clear that Tony views the Native American half of his Urban Indian identity as a "curse" (16). 
Despite his rejection of his Native American identity, Tony still displays signs of embracing that side of his Urban Indian identity subconsciously. We get a glimpse of this at the end of the first chapter, when Tony wears his Native American regelia in preparation to the robbery: "I looked at my face. The Drome. I didn't see it there. I saw an Indian." (26) Tony not seeing the "Drome" indicates that the action of putting the regelia on allowed Tony to temporarily ignore the negative aspects of his Native American identity and embrace his identity as an Urban Indian. 
As the main character of the first and last chapter, Tony's exploration of his identity as an Urban Indian is central to There There. Through his depiction of Tony's exploration of his own identity, Orange is able to communicate that there is a bit of Native American identity within every Urban Indian, no matter how much it is rejected.
