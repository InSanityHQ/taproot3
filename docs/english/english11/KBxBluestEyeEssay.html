{INTRO} - pecola experiences - fracturing identity - look into phychi -
mapping - THESIS: Pecola's inner dialogue &#x2013; mapping directly to Freud's
model of mind &#x2013; explains the resultant insanity of living in a world
where societal values are unachievable.
</p>

<p>
Pecola's inner dialogue operates within a context created by societal
values, as explained by Freud's concept of the super-ego. According to
Freud, the super-ego acts as the interpreter of reality and thus the
definer of internal values. These internal values are sourced from
cultural context, creating a "mental system that reflects the
internalization of cultural rules" (CITE). Both voices in Pecola's
dialogue are shown to operate within the super-ego. The voice of Pecola,
shown in non-italics, obsesses over the concept of blue eyes: "they get
prettier each time I look at them" she claims, even bringing a mirror
outside to continue staring. Conversing with her imaginary friend, she
asks: Are they really nice? <i>Yes. Very nice.</i><br />
Just "very nice"? <i>Really, truly, very nice.</i> Really, truly, bluely
nice? (CITE) Through asking if her eyes are "bluely nice," Pecola ties
{equates?} blue eyes to the concept of nice &#x2013; a tie that her imaginary
friend also buys into without question. Pecola continues, asking if her
supposedly blue eyes are "prettier than Alice-and-Jerry Storybook eyes,"
referencing a source of the internalized and even institutionalized
racism Pecola's super-ego embodies. Societal values of attributes
associated with whiteness have been internalized by Pecola's super-ego,
creating a world where the values she strives for are only achievable
through illusion.
</p>

<p>
Pecola's primary voice, shown in non-italics, is explained by Freud's
model of the id &#x2013; the part of mind responsible for desire. Being the
first part of mind developed, the id is the host of impulse.(CITE?) This
impulsive nature of the id is shown by Pecola's incessant glances into
her mirror multiple "<i>times a minute</i>," because she "just like[s] to
look." (CITE) Pecola's id is constantly trying to sate her impulses, the
source of which she has no explanation for other than that she "just
like[s]" certain things. However, the id, described by Freud as "a
cauldron full of seething excitations," is insatiable. (CITE) Despite
being overjoyed at getting her supposedly blue eyes, Pecola proclaims
that "he [Mr. Soaphead] should have made them bluer." (CITE) Pecola's id
is no longer content with simply having blue eyes &#x2013; instead, hers must
be the "the bluest eyes in the whole world." (CITE). The non-italicized
voice also believes that her eyes will "last forever," showing another
trait of the id: timelessness. According to Freud, there is "nothing in
the id which corresponds to the idea of time." (CITE) Moreover, not only
are her thoughts and desires timeless, but also contradictory; "contrary
impulses" existing "side by side, without canceling each other" is yet
another trait of the id. Pecola's internal world is consumed by the
supposed glory of blue eyes, yet when the italicized voice asks: "what
would I look like with blue eyes?" Pecola's id responds: "nothing much."
(CITE). The non-italicized voice in Pecola's dialogue consists of
first-order impulsiveness, insatiability, timelessness, and
contradictory thoughts &#x2013; all characteristic attributes of the id. {tie

<p>
ordering - "the only one who tells me how pretty they are." &#x2013; seeks to
please the id? - "<i>how many times are you going to look at that thing?</i>"
&#x2013; resisting impulses - "You're being silly." "That's just too bad,
isn't it?" &#x2013; tried to keep the id in check - "Not around here, anyway."
"So what? You asked for blue eyes. You got blue eyes." tries to pull
back to the realm of reality, even through delusion - but it fails!
</p>

<p>
The final actor in Pecola's conversation, shown in italics, represents
Pecola's ego &#x2013; the mediator between the id and the version of reality
created by the super-ego. It is the ego's job to attempt to please the
id by operating "between id and reality," navigating the balance between
satisfaction (often, as well as in this case, illusion) and reality
(CITE). The ego, unlike the id, is said to be modified by "direct
influence of the external world," an effect evident when Pecola stares
at the sun (CITE). "<i>Ow!</i>" exclaims Pecola's ego, "<i>The sun is too
bright. It hurts my eyes.</i>" Pecola's id responds, "Not mine. [&#x2026;] I can
look right at the sun. [&#x2026;] It doesn't hurt." Pecola's id is seemingly
not directly influenced by the external world, while her ego is.
Furthermore, her ego tries to mediate between these two different
experiences: "<i>Well, blink anyway</i>" the ego requests (CITE). Consistent
with Freud's model, Pecola's ego also attempts to please the id &#x2014; "you
are the only one who tells me how pretty they are" comments Pecola's id
(CITE). Her ego consistently makes comments such as "<i>that's right,</i>"
"<i>oh, yes. Much bluer,</i>" and "<i>yes, they sure are prejudiced.</i>" (CITE).
However, the ego must also balance these affirmations with denunciations
&#x2014; "<i>you're being silly,</i>", "<i>that's just too bad, isn't it?</i>" &#x2014; as
well as control the id's impulses &#x2014; "<i>how many times are you going to
look at that [mirror]?</i>" (CITE).

<p>
Pecola's ego attempts to navigate the balance between affirmation of the
id and control of it. Her ego consistently makes comments
</p>

<p>
"Yes, they sure are prejudiced." "That's right." "Oh, yes. Much bluer."
</p>

<p>
“Leave me alone! You better leave me alone.
</p>

<p>
Can't you take a joke? I was only funning.
</p>

<p>
I don't like to talk about dirty things.
</p>

<p>
Me neither. Let's talk about something else.
</p>

<p>
What? What will we talk about?
</p>

<p>
Why, your eyes.
</p>

<p>
Oh, yes. My eyes. My blue eyes. Let me look again.
</p>

<p>
See how pretty they are.
</p>

<p>
Yes. They get prettier each time I look at them.
</p>

<p>
They are the prettiest I've ever seen.
</p>

<p>
Really?
</p>

<p>
Oh, yes.”
