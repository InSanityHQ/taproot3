  nobody'll fuck with me. Everybody runs like they seen a ghost. Maybe I
  am a ghost. Maybe Maxine doesn't even know who I am. Maybe I'm the
  opposite of a medicine person. Maybe I'm'a do something one day, and

  and when they would be served. We stayed on the island because there
  was no other choice. There was no house or life to go back to, no hope
  that maybe we would get what we were asking for, that the government
  would have mercy on us, spare our throats by sending boats of food and
  electricians, builders, and contractors to fix the place up. The days
  just passed, and nothing happened. [...] 'We're gonna get outta here.
  Don't you two worry,' our mom said to us one night from across the
  cell. But I no longer trusted her. I was unsure of whose side she was
  on, or if there were even sides anymore. Maybe there were only sides
  like there were sides on the rocks at the edge of the island." (45)</span></p></li><li><p><span>"Dene thinks Calvin is nervous, but then Dene is nervous, he is always

  slippery slope because everything could be projection. He is regularly

  mysteriously stopped, then couldn't seeing, hearing, breathing, do so

  cancel out. I'm overthinking it." (50)</span></p></li><li><p><span>"Opal carried the weight of Ronald's possible death around with her

is described as carrying the weight of his possible death. This
possibility, this state of "maybe" is what Opal is carrying. Opal
doesn't want Ronald to be "still alive," but she doesn't want to have
killed him either; she is choosing the weight of uncertainty over the
weight of responsibility. This state of "maybe" is not a transitional
state, as Opal let's Ronald stay "maybe dead." Instead, it is a state of
being. In a world of uncertainty and tragedy, letting reality sit in a
state of maybe becomes "easier," and weight of uncertainty becomes
comforting.</span></p><hr /><p><span>scared of own lack of morality? physical weight? "possible death" not
carrying the death itself but the uncertainty wants him to be dead, but

where characters wonder about the world without seeking or even valuing
answers. This lack of expectation of answers reflects the characters
lived experiences -- growing up in an environment of unanswered crimes
and horrible truths. The book itself is not even asking for answers,
it's only detailing the modern day effects of the atrocities committed
in the past. These constant unanswered questions that the characters ask
encapsulate how they have been forced to interact with the world
surrounding them.</span></p></section></div></div></div></div></article><div class="metapanel"><div class="metalabel">Contents</div><ol><li><a href="#motif:-maybe">motif: maybe.</a><ol><li><a href="#analysis">Analysis</a></li></ol></li></ol><div class="metalabel">Backlinks</div><ul class="firn-backlinks"><li class="firn-backlink"><a href="/english/english11/index">English 11 Master Index</a></li></ul></div></main></body></html>
