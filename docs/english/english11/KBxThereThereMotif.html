  looking like a monster works out for me. The Drome. And when I stand
  up, when I stand up real fucking tall like I can, nobody'll fuck with
  me. Everybody runs like they seen a ghost. Maybe I am a ghost. Maybe
  Maxine doesn't even know who I am. Maybe I'm the opposite of a
  medicine person. Maybe I'm'a do something one day, and everybody's
  gonna know about me. Maybe that's when I'll come to life. Maybe that's
  when they'll finally be able to look at me, because they'll have to."

  myself lucky to have a bear with two shoes and not just one. But then
  bears don't wear shoes, so maybe I wasn't lucky" (38)</span></p></li><li><p><span>"After that we did nothing every day but find out what the meals were
  and when they would be served. We stayed on the island because there
  was no other choice. There was no house or life to go back to, no hope
  that maybe we would get what we were asking for, that the government
  would have mercy on us, spare our throats by sending boats of food and
  electricians, builders, and contractors to fix the place up. The days
  just passed, and nothing happened. The boats came and went with fewer
  and fewer supplies. There was a fire at some point, and I saw people
  pulling copper wire out of the walls of the buildings, carrying the
  bundles down to the boats. The men looked more tired and more drunk
  more often, and there were fewer and fewer women and children around.
  “We're gonna get outta here. Don't you two worry," our mom said to us
  one night from across the cell. But I no longer trusted her. I was
  unsure of whose side she was on, or if there were even sides anymore.
  Maybe there were only sides like there were sides on the rocks at the
  edge of the island.” (45)</span></p></li><li><p><span>"Dene thinks Calvin is nervous, but then Dene is nervous, he is always
  nervous, so maybe it's projection. But projection as a concept is a
  slippery slope because everything could be projection. He is regularly
  subject to solipsism's recursive, drowning affect." (109)</span></p></li><li><p><span>"Opal carried the weight of Ronald's possible death around with her
  for a year. She was scared to go back and check. She was afraid that
  it didn't bother her that he was dead. That she killed him. She didn't
  want to go and find out if he was still alive. But she didn't really
  want to have killed him either. It was easier to let him stay maybe
  dead. Possibly dead." (121)</span></p></li><li><p><strong><span>Why are these particular passage(s) significant in the larger
