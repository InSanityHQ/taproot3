doesnt bother to answer because not expecting an answer

reflecs lived in contecxt of unanswered crimes

*Evidence (multiple instances) and close-reading analysis of one passage
(examine particular speaker choices in literary craft: style, syntax,
word choice/connotation, allusion, etc. What do these choices suggest or
connote?)*

\begin{itemize}
\item "got this big body to help me since my face got it so bad. That's how
looking like a monster works out for me. The Drome. And when I stand
up, when I stand up real fucking tall like I can, nobody'll fuck with
me. Everybody runs like they seen a ghost. Maybe I am a ghost. Maybe
Maxine doesn't even know who I am. Maybe I'm the opposite of a
medicine person. Maybe I'm'a do something one day, and everybody's
gonna know about me. Maybe that's when I'll come to life. Maybe that's
when they'll finally be able to look at me, because they'll have to."
(18)\\

\item "Her bear wasn't named One Shoe, but maybe I should have considered
myself lucky to have a bear with two shoes and not just one. But then
bears don't wear shoes, so maybe I wasn't lucky" (38)

\item "After that we did nothing every day but find out what the meals were
and when they would be served. We stayed on the island because there
was no other choice. There was no house or life to go back to, no hope
that maybe we would get what we were asking for, that the government
would have mercy on us, spare our throats by sending boats of food and
electricians, builders, and contractors to fix the place up. The days
just passed, and nothing happened. The boats came and went with fewer
and fewer supplies. There was a fire at some point, and I saw people
pulling copper wire out of the walls of the buildings, carrying the
bundles down to the boats. The men looked more tired and more drunk
more often, and there were fewer and fewer women and children around.
“We're gonna get outta here. Don't you two worry," our mom said to us
one night from across the cell. But I no longer trusted her. I was
unsure of whose side she was on, or if there were even sides anymore.
Maybe there were only sides like there were sides on the rocks at the
edge of the island.” (45)

\item "Dene thinks Calvin is nervous, but then Dene is nervous, he is always
nervous, so maybe it's projection. But projection as a concept is a
slippery slope because everything could be projection. He is regularly
subject to solipsism's recursive, drowning affect." (109)

\item "Opal carried the weight of Ronald's possible death around with her
for a year. She was scared to go back and check. She was afraid that
it didn't bother her that he was dead. That she killed him. She didn't
want to go and find out if he was still alive. But she didn't really
want to have killed him either. It was easier to let him stay maybe
dead. Possibly dead." (121)

\item \textbf{Why are these particular passage(s) significant in the larger
development or role of the motif as a whole within the novel?}
\end{itemize}
