Sultans in a row.

initiative, disent, and commerce"

\item \begin{quote}
An idiot sultan could paralyze the Ottoman empire in the way
that a pope or Holy Roman emperor could never do for all Europe.
\{p12\}
\end{quote}

\item \begin{quote}
Without clear directives from above, the arteries of the
bureaucracy hardened, preferring conservatism to change, and
stifling innovation.
\end{quote}

\item Poverty -> internal plundering

\begin{itemize}
\item Lack of expanstion and hence riches combined with the "vast rise
in prices" caused janissaries to "turn to internal plunder"

and "outright seuizure of property"

\end{quote}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\item Main Ideas:

\begin{itemize}
\item Infighting

\begin{itemize}
\item expansion

\begin{itemize}
\item Iron first tactic of crushing others led to them uniting
against the ottomans
\item Harder to keep expanding, imperialism was no longer profitable
\item Needed good leadership / new direction, but heavy
centralization allowed for a single "idiot" leader to stall
the empire completely. This happened thirteen times in a row.
\item This made bureaucracy harden, which led to a culture of
conservatism
\item Lack of income lead to infighting and plundering
\item Threat from Shi'ite religions led to cracking down on free
thought

\begin{itemize}
\item Stifled innovation + income\\

\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

These periods of change reveal the problems faced by huge, land
based empires around the world
\end{quote}

turkish cavalryman presented by gunpowder and christian prisoner
of war
\end{itemize}

\item Taxed male children for warriors \{p489\}
\end{itemize}

\item Fall

\begin{itemize}
\item Crisis of the military state

\begin{itemize}
\item Newer tech -> greater importance of cannons and light weight
fire arms

\item late 16th century, influx of silver led to inflation,
landholders couldn't report for military duty \{490\}

\item Canvalrymen reduced / put out of buisness, replaced with
janissary corps.

\item Also scholars suffered from reduced income\\

\item Cannot fundementaly alter tax system due to religous law.

\item Government recruited short term soldies which were out of money
when the campaign ended

\item \begin{quote}
Former landholding cavalrymen, short-term soldiers released at
the end of a campaign, peasants overburdened by emergency
taxes, and even impoverished students of religion formed bands
of marauders.
\end{quote}
\end{itemize}

\item Economic change and growing weakness

\begin{itemize}
\item Kept sultans confined to the palace so they woudnt start coups

\begin{itemize}
\item led to them not being experienced with the real world
\end{itemize}

\item Janissaries used their increased power to make privliges in
their corps hereditary
\end{itemize}

incomes hard

seaborne trade \{494\}

\item Tulip period\ldots{}?

\item Central governments weakness allowed smaller leaders to fragment
the nation.

\item \begin{quote}
Although no region declared full independence, the sultan's
power was slipping away to the advantage of a broad array of
lower officials and upstart chieftains in all parts of the
empire while the Ottoman economy was reorienting itself toward
Europe.
\end{quote}
\end{itemize}

\item Main Ideas

\begin{itemize}
\item Inflation

\begin{itemize}
\item Influx of silver led to soldiers and students with fixed
salaries starving
\item Only mention of conservatism (probs): coudn't fundamentally
change tax system due to religious law
\end{itemize}

\item Formed bands of marauders
\item Trade agreements allowed the Europeans to dominate in seaborne
Trade
\item Central government allowed smaller leaders to fragment the nation
