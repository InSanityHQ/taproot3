reopening after

Zheng He's expeditions, there was a run on currency that cause hyper in-
and de- flation due to incapable leadership and faulty systems. This
caused a reliance on silver, which brings with it

\subsection{A little history lesson\ldots{}}
\label{sec:org90d9651}
\href{KBhHIST201MannMing.org}{KBhHIST201MannMing} (C. Mann's) 1500s
Ming

\begin{itemize}
\item Originally started as bronze coins
\item Became inefficient and so started printing paper money
\item Bronze production could not match paper money

\begin{itemize}
\item Paper money became \emph{fiat money}--- had purchasing power but no
backing
\item But! Fiat money is usually good for government

\begin{itemize}
\item Not influenced by metal prices
\item Could be decoupled and printed at will\\
\item Which\ldots{}. Resulted in the Yuan overdoing it and inventing
\textbf{hyperinflation}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Ming vs.Â Hyperinflation}
\label{sec:org10f9eca}
\href{KBhHIST201MannMing.org}{KBhHIST201MannMing} (C. Mann's) 1500s
Ming

\begin{itemize}
\item China tried to counter inflation by not printing money

\begin{itemize}
\item Caused economic hardship
\item Deflation to the point where merchants are starting to accept
counterfeits
\item One emperor came up with the brilliant idea of counterfit-proof
currency, but that only helped adoption for about a year
\item Emperors kept banning and failing to ban currencies

\begin{itemize}
\item Used the strategy of "your money is not worth it anymore" to
prevent hyperinflation
\item Unfortunately, caused problems surrounding the fact that currency
as a whole became untrustworthy
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Ming

\begin{itemize}
\item People resorted to carrying around silver, which was\ldots{} better, but it
is quite inefficient as well => coins ultimately made up 1/10ths of
transactions

\begin{itemize}
\item Government gave in, started asking for taxes in silver too
\item Creating unhealthy feedback loop leading to
\href{KBhHIST201ProblemsWithSilver.org}{KBhHIST201ProblemsWithSilver}
Problems with Silver

\begin{itemize}
\item People sold silk and porcelain to side silver merchants
\item Used silver to pay taxes
\item Taxes fund operations against silver merchants
\item "Ming government was at war with its own money supply"
\end{itemize}

\item Eventually, government gave in and allowed people to trade overseas
with, sigh\ldots{}, silver, ushering in
