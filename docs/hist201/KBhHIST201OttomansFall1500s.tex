Chapter 19

\begin{itemize}
\item Affected landowners
\item Could not build stronger millitary
\item Caused the weakening of calvalrymen + increase in reliance on POWs
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Overconservatism}
\label{sec:org9d7b1fa}
@\href{KBhHIST201KennedyCh1.org}{KBhHIST201KennedyCh1} Kenedy, Chapter
1

\begin{quote}
"Natural consequences of earlier Turkish successes"
\end{quote}

\begin{itemize}
\item Got Romanitus --- expanded too much to the point of unmanagability =>
"Strategical Overextension"
\item Switched to an "Iron Fist" management style of crushing dissidents,
encouraging the Persians to ally with the Europeans to crush the
Ottomans
\item Suffered from being centralized, despotic, and severly orthodox

\begin{itemize}
\item Emperor had to much power
\item Country became over-conservative \#why
\item Bureaucracy became too heavy
\end{itemize}

\item Heavy internal plundering

\begin{itemize}
\item High taxes
\item Seizures of property
\item Depopulated towns
\item Unorderly soldiers
\item Bribery
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Chapter 19

\begin{quote}
"Religious laws \ldots{} constrained the ottomans from reforming the tax
system"
\end{quote}

\begin{itemize}
\item Levied surtaxes
\item Caused rebellions + banditry
\item POWS took advantage of influence to gain the ability to marry and do
business, but overall caused deterioation of the qualitiy of the
millitary (less professionals, more POWs)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Declining government}
\label{sec:org6576c09}
@\href{KBhHIST201BullietCh19.org}{KBhHIST201BullietCh19}

\subsubsection{Sultans kept to themselves}
\label{sec:org7805984}
\begin{itemize}
\item Prevented male relatives from leaving the palace
\item \emph{Females gained larger rule} + chief administrators oversaw the actual
government \textbf{important!}: CLAIM --- sterotipically, muslim culture had
fears of woman in politics
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Dismantling original systems}
\label{sec:orgbe555ec}
\begin{itemize}
\item Land grants for millitary services disappeared
\item Abolished devshirme system which selected POW officers
\item Tax farming became allowed

\begin{itemize}
\item Tax collectors are allowed to pre-paid tax and collect any amount to
recouperate
\item Caused local administration to suffer due to the above
\end{itemize}

\item Corruption within the government lead them to give power to tax
collectors

\begin{itemize}
\item Causing them to control the incomes and expenses of a regions
\item Which turns them into large private landowners
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{The armies kept deteriorating}
\label{sec:orge4ed76f}
\begin{itemize}
\item Resorted to hiring substitutes
\item Also relied partially on trained seasonal recruits
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{European trade capitulations}
\label{sec:orgfb89290}
\begin{itemize}
\item Europeans took control of Ottomans' overseas trade "Capitulations" ---
special trade agreements

\begin{itemize}
\item European domination of Ottoman seaborne trade
\item Muslim merchants are trading at a disadvantage due to this
domination
\end{itemize}

\item Few Ottoman statesmen observed the change, but they are generally
disregarded
\item "Tulip Craze" => European integration

\begin{itemize}
\item Early sign of destruction shown with the Ottomans' craze on Tulips
\item European cultures integrated into the Ottoman culture --- clothing,
books, furtinutes
\item At \emph{gala soirees}, Janissaries revolted, causing the abdication of
Sultan Ahmed III
\end{itemize}

\item Eventually, Janissary commanders became independent rulers, causing a
slip of control
\end{itemize}

\noindent\rule{\textwidth}{0.5pt}

\begin{itemize}
\item Rural disorder also caused new economic opportunities

\begin{itemize}
\item CLAIM: ottoman's lack of control brings other European costal
regions to resume originally Ottoman controlled trades
\item Local farmers shifted growth to cash crops (tobacco, cotton, oil,
etc.)
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{document}
