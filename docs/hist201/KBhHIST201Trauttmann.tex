\item Converted Indians
\item Established Roman Pope's supermicy over already Existant Thomas
Christians
\item Employed two strategies

\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\item Porchugual vs. Spain

\begin{itemize}
\item Squabble squabble squabble
\item Eventually the\ldots{} Pope? settled the issue: awarding Portugal every

\begin{itemize}
\item Indian princes leased independently-governed trading posts
("factories") to help either one side or the other
\item Eventually BEI.C army defeated Mughal army in 1757, and
effectively achieved independence in Bengal by installing a new
governor

admin (\emph{diwani}) of the region
\end{itemize}

\item Company rule lasted from 1765-1858 when India is officially ruled
by the crown
\end{itemize}

\item Ruling strategy

Amercia problem
\item Prevented admission of non-company Europeans, including
missionaries

\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\item 1857 Mutiny

\item Causes

\begin{itemize}
\item The Enfield rifle cartridge wsa greased with animal fat =>
offended the Hindu + Muslim
\item Policy of "Lapse" => dissolving princely states without direct
heir
\end{itemize}

\item Felt like that the religion was under attack
\item Mutiny spread across India, but it was eventually quelled after a
year because it was not unified

rule
\item Aftermath

\begin{itemize}
\item Mutineers were punished harshly
\item Mughal Empire formally abolished w/ the king exiled to Burmar
\item In Nov 1, 1858, the Queen assumed control of India => direct
parlimentary control

\begin{itemize}
\item Initially worked under a interference policy

\begin{itemize}
\item Goal was not to take over
\item All had the shared goal of making money for the Company
\item Minimal government for the goal of law-and-order
\end{itemize}

\item Jesuits spreader Christianity => Beschi very successful. BEI.C
eventually prohibited it.
\item Family and civil disputes settled based on religious court; criminal
and contract law were made uniform => law that hinged on religion
remained a problem until this day
\item Company took the stance of minimal interference in land revenue,
too!

\begin{itemize}
\item Created policy of settling revenue in obligation to \emph{zamindars}
\end{itemize}

\item CLAIM: minimal interference came under pressure during attempted
Indian reform to European values

\begin{itemize}
\item Newly settled land identity on individual cultivator
\item Government reached every cultivator directory + not through
landlords
\item New reformation movements Utilitarinasm => governmental reform,
and evangelical movement => social reform
\end{itemize}

\item This reforamtion ebbed and flowed: Britian, after 1857 rebellion,
decided that they overdid it and tuned down the reformation
\item European reform of India

\begin{itemize}
\item New family + kinship rules
\item Brought the idea of popular soverenty as a cool governmental model
\item Higher respect for learning, science, and technology => turning
India from the centre of learning to not and to respecting
learning again due to THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION

\begin{itemize}
\item Textiles! (destructing handicraft along with it)
\item Railway!
\item Historiography of India!
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
