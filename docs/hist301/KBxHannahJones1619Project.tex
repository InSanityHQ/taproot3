\begin{verbatim}
Our Democracy's Founding Ideals were False when they were written. Black Americans have fought to make them true.
\end{verbatim}

\begin{itemize}
\item always has pristine american flag even though everything else is
crumbling

\begin{itemize}
\item dad grew up as a slave
\item family tried to leave and failed
\end{itemize}

\item dad joined the army to serve the country, so the contry would treat
him as american

\item didnt understand patriotism because america treated black people so
poorly

\begin{itemize}
\item was embarrased by the flag outside
\end{itemize}

\item slaves contributed greatly to the succes and creation of america?

\item one fith of the country!

\item argues that black people are the exemplars and the progressers of our
democracy

\item argues that black people have fought in many wars

\begin{itemize}
\item are the most likely of all racial groups to serve in the us military
\end{itemize}

\item says that the nations true founding fathers are the slaves!

\item says that the brutal system of slavery was unlike anything that had
existed before

\begin{itemize}
\item is that true??
\end{itemize}

\item democratic ideals, according to the author:

\begin{itemize}
\item higher min wage,
\item ubi
\end{itemize}

\item black americans suffer most from violent crime

\begin{itemize}
\item 13\% population, 36\% of non-fatal violent crime?
\end{itemize}

\item talks about apropiation?
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
about how black people created the country, and fought for freedom and are thus the most american? 
does what your ancenstors did effect how american you are? if born black post slavery, does you still get the amerizanizing fought slavery credit? 
should we really distinguish who is american by race?

races are equal, not better.

ig claims that being american is fighting for freedom and believing in the ideals?
