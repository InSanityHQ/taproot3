your projects. - A difficult problem for me that I 'solved' was the very
last problem in the Neural Networks assignment: making the model perform
better. While sounding simple enough, the process I went about doing
this was essentially guess and check; it was a type of computer science
problem that was almost entirely new to me. In fact, I don't know if it
can quite be considered a science yet --- perhaps this is what the
transition stage from an 'art' to a 'science' looks like?</span></p><ul><li><p><span>Of the concepts we discussed, which one(s) did you find most
  interesting or useful, and why?</span></p><ul><li><p><span>More broadly speaking, a concept that we have discussed in proxy is
    the sheer power and beauty of emergent properties. One of the
    reasons that makes ML so interesting and so unique (at least to me)
    is that it deals with harnessing this power of emergent property to
    form a type of intelligence.</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><span>What concepts did you find most challenging, and why?</span></p><ul><li><p><span>Convolution Neural Networks confused me quite a bit, as I didn't
    have a strong understanding of how basic Neural Networks worked
    going in. This made me miss the importance of the differences of a
    CNN; after the fact, I now have an altered outlook on how I should
    approach learning about specialized topics.</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><span>What are some ways that you displayed good habits of mind or
  contributed to a good learning environment in the class?</span></p><ul><li><p><span>I am genuinely interested in ML. I spent a lot of my time working
    with a good friend; my belief is that approaching learning this way
    will naturally lead to good habits of mind.</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><span>What was the most useful or memorable piece of feedback you received
  this semester, and how did you act on it?</span></p><ul><li><p><span>One of the most memorable pieces of feedback was this: "However, the
    exercise isn't merely a coding exercise --- it's also to answer the
    question." I coudn't belief that I had gotten so caught up in the
    code that I missed the point of the question! --- It was a good
    reminder to step back and untangle myself from the weeds every once
    in a while.</span></p></li></ul></li></ul></section></div></div></article><div class="metapanel"><div class="metalabel">Contents</div><div class="metalabel">Backlinks</div><ul class="firn-backlinks"><li class="firn-backlink"><a href="/history/history10/KBMlMasterIndex">Ml Master Index</a></li></ul></div></main></body></html>
