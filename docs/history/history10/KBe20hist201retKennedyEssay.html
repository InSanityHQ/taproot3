  decision. The northern frontiers of the empire were again under some
  pressure from the Mongols, and it may have seemed prudent to
  concentrate military resources in this more vulnerable area. Under
  such circumstances a large navy was an expensive luxury, and in any
  case, the attempted Chinese expansion southward into Annam (Vietnam)
  was proving fruitless and costly. Yet this quite valid reasoning does
  not appear to have been reconsidered when the disadvantages of naval
  retrenchment later became clear: within a century or so, the Chinese
  coastline and even cities on the Yangtze were being attacked by
  Japanese pirates, but there was no serious rebuilding of an imperial
  navy. Even the repeated appearance of Portuguese vessels off the China
  coast did not force a reassessment. Defense on land was all that was
  required, the mandarins reasoned, for had not all maritime trade by
  Chinese subjects been forbidden in any case? Apart from the costs and
  other disincentives involved, therefore, a key element in China's
  retreat was the sheer conservatism of the Confucian bureaucracy---a
  conservatism heightened in the Ming period by resentment at the
  changes earlier forced upon them by the Mongols. In this "Restoration"
  atmosphere, the all-important officialdom concerned to preserve and
  recapture the past, not to create a brighter future based upon
  overseas expansion and commerce. According to the Confucian code,
  warfare itself was a deplorable activity and armed forces were made
  necessary only by the fear of barbarian attacks or internal revolts.
  The mandarins' dislike of the army (and the navy) was accompanied by a
  suspicion of the trader. The accumulation of private capital, the
  practice of buying cheap and selling dear, the ostentation of the
  nouveau riche merchant, all offended the elite, scholarly
  bureaucrats---almost as much as they aroused the resentments of the
  toiling masses. While not wishing to bring the entire market economy
  to a halt, the mandarins often intervened against individual merchants
  by confiscating their property or banning their business. Foreign
  trade by Chinese subjects must have seemed even more dubious to
  mandarin eyes, simply because it was less under their control.</span></p></blockquote><ul><li><p><span>Wrong</span></p><ul><li><p><span>"a key element in China's retreat was the sheer conservatism of the

elaborates "all contact with the world outside was supposed to be
supervised by Beijing" (Kennedy 7, Mann 127). Although Kennedy doesn't
provide much detail on what he means by "sheer conservatism", Mann
supplement's Kennedy's argument by explaining Beijing's plan to limit
and supervise trade relations with the outside world. All sources agree
that on a high level, Confucianism's conservative values played a major
role in China's restrictive trade policies.</span></p><p><span>However, Kennedy inaccurately suggests that Confucian China stopped
trade due to a dislike of commerce and cultural complacency. Kennedy
writes "[Foreign trade] must have seemed even more dubious to mandarin
eyes", whose imprecise wording and questionable support heavily
contrasts the rest of the text; He further milks this dubious claim by
generalizing it to a "dislike of commerce" (Kennedy 8). A more nuanced
take notes counters that Beijing's slashing on private trade with
foreign parties is a means of consolidating power and centralizing
profit, instead of due to a generic distaste of trade (Mann 126). In
fact, the benefits of foreign trade were known and considered--a retired
Ming official writes "our expense is still less than one ten-thousandth
of the benefit we gain from trading with them" (Zhang Han). That the
author was retired and still actively writing about the importance of
trade with foreign powers shows that trade had not been a niche concept
but rather a generally considered and debated topic within the mandarin
court. The Chinese did not decimate public trade because they found it
distasteful--the advantages of trade were known and leveraged and the
private ban was a part of their plan. Kennedy also writes that "Ming
China was a much less vigorous and enterprising land" and gives the
impression that some cultural complacency is at fault (Kennedy 8).
However, Kennedy again assumes the claim and uses it as a transition--a
deeper analysis reveals that trade-oriented merchants joined forces with
pirates to ensure their business. At one point, they fought off the
imperial forces sent to pacify them and later invited illegal foreign
smugglers onto Chinese land (Mann 133).</span></p><p><span>Contrary to Kennedy's simplification, the Ming government banned foreign
trade to control and profit international relations through tributary
interactions. Mann elaborates on an important detail: the Chinese
allowed foreign nations to pay tribute to the emperor, who would give
them small gifts in return. The submissive nation would often be allowed
to sell extra goods to the masses, which essentially turned the scheme
into an outlet for foreign trade under strict government control (Mann
127). Internally, these visitations were thought of as assertions of
dominance because the only way foreigners could trade with China was
under the name of tributary contributions (Zhang Han). Ultimately Ming
China banned private trade with foreign parties not due to a Confucian
dislike of commerce or cultural lack of vigor, but rather as a tool to
consolidate government power and make a profit. Although historians
concur that aspects of Ming China's Confucian philosophy played a major
role in the decline of foreign interaction, Kennedy's assumption
#todo-exr0n WC) that this was due to a dislike of trade and cultural
triumphancy is debunked by realizing the political and economic
motivations--the Ming did not ban trade but rather reframed and
restricted it for governmental advantage.</span></p><ul><li><p><span>"But as long as they were content to remain at the margin of

### Thesis Although John Kennedy correctly traces the Ming government's
distaste for ( #todo-exr0n word choice: commoner trade) to conservative
Confucianism, he incorrectly attributes the Ming slashing of foreign
trade to a lack cultural vigor--this was instead an attempt to control
and profit.</span></p></section><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="body-1"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Body 1</span></span></h3><section><p><span>As Kennedy notes, the Ming government banned foreign trade for due to
