For instance, in 1880--nine years after Germany was officially unified--the German empire produced only 8.5% of the world's manufacturing output while Britain produce 22.9% of it.

As Germany doubled it's military population over three decades to challenge century-long British and French domination, nearby countries grew wary.

This so called "security dilemma" doubled the number of military and navel personel worldwide in the 30 years between the German unification and the war, and nearly tripled the global warship tonnage (Kennedy, Table 19-20). A level two perspcetive would explain this aggression with Germany's expansionistic ideals, but even Britain's liberal parliamentary democracy quadrupled it's naval tonnage.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="cult-of-the-offensive"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>cult of the offensive</span></span></h3><section><p><span>	Leaders at the time believed that preempting war would allow a fast and decisive victory. Even simplifying the outcomes to two countries and four possibilites, where each country either attacks or defends, greedy actors will choose to preempt war. As a result, each country prepared to invade it's neighboors, and European tensions grew.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="mutually-assured-destruction"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>mutually assured destruction</span></span></h3><section><p><span>	In fact, had a there been an international disencentive such as Mutually Assured Destruction, the relative ordering of possibilites and therefore the cost matrix would've prevented all out war between such parties. For example, in a nuclear scenerio where any attacked country can retaliate with their own warheads, the utility of each scenerio would be ordered as follows:</span></p><table><tr><td><span>Utility</span></td><td><span>Our Actions</span></td><td><span>Their Actions</span></td></tr><tr></tr><tr><td><span>4</span></td><td><span>Defend</span></td><td><span>Defend</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>3</span></td><td><span>Attack</span></td><td><span>Defend</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>2</span></td><td><span>Attack</span></td><td><span>Attack</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>1</span></td><td><span>Defend</span></td><td><span>Attack</span></td></tr></table><p><span>	And in a two party system,</span></p><table><tr><td><span>Top,Left</span></td><td><span>Attack</span></td><td><span>Defend</span></td></tr><tr></tr><tr><td><span>Attack</span></td><td><span>2, 2</span></td><td><span>1, 3</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>Defend</span></td><td><span>3, 1</span></td><td><span>4, 4</span></td></tr></table><p><span>	Although it may seem less risky for any given party to attack, the utility of both defend increases as weapons get stronger until both parties opt for a defense strategy under MAD. Modern mutually assured destruction has so far prevented all out war, and a lack of such disincentives made war more likely in the early 1900s.</span></p></section></div></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="todo-bp2:-upset--war-hungry-people-are-required-to-spark-the-war"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>TODO BP2: upset / war-hungry people are required to spark the war</span></span></h2><section><p><span>   As a side effect of this global militarization, the populous glorified and anticipated war. This level three influence on the level one psyche inflamed nationalist ideals across Europe and primed a now-ticking explosive.</span></p><p><span>	Popular works from the years leading up to the war describe how natural and necessary war is.
	For instance, German general and influential military writer Friedrich von Bernhardi (1849-1930) wrote in </span><em><span>Germany and the Next War</span></em><span> (1911) that "War is a biological necessity of the first importance," and "The right of conquest is universally acknowledged." (CITE)
	As both a high-ranking general and a best-selling author, Bernhardi was in a unique position to influence the public opinion about war. His aggressive stance is not surprising given his military background, and his work was instrumental to priming Germany for battle. A nation cannot go to war without the support of the populous, as the citizens at large provide the troops, taxes, and labor to sustain warfare. Such vehement arguments swayed public opinion and opened the possibility of large-scale battle.</span></p><p><span>	A level two viewpoint may counter that Germany was naturally expansionist, but similar widespread sentiment in France suggests government structure and ideology were not a sufficient influence on public opinion. French writer Ronald Dorgeles (1885-1973) recalls the mood in Paris at the outbreak of war, writing "Suddenly a heroic wind lifted their heads. What? War, was it? Well then, let's go!" (CITE)
	The French parliamentary constitutional government had been weakened by civil unrest and would hardly have been able to force a uncooperative populous to war, but even the left-wing activists agreed in August of 1914 to refrain from calling strikes during the duration of the war in the Union Sacrée or Sacred Union. (CITE needed? :question: https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/026569147800800402?journalCode=ehqa) Thus, French actions could not have been primarily governmental influence, and such countries went to war due to level three influences on public opinion.</span></p><p><span>	An exclusively level one viewpoint may counter that German writers like Heinrich von Treitschke had been espousing and glorifying war decades before the rapid German industrialization beginning in 1970. However, the shift was more recent in other countries. For instance, Dorgeles notes the ideological one-eighty that socialist workers take upon hearing of war. "seeing their old dreams of peace crumble, [socialism workers] would stream out into the boulevards ... [but] they would cry 'To Berlin!,' not 'Down with war!'" (CITE) Although Germany's actions may be a result of it's level two structure, the level three influence on level one psyche is required to explain the actions of other states.</span></p></section><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="serbs-in-austria-want-to-make-yugoslavia-(also-bosnia?)"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>serbs in austria want to make yugoslavia (also bosnia?)</span></span></h3><section><p><span>	As countries militarized and nationalist views grew, would ethnic and religious divisions intensify until something inevitably sparked war.
	In the case of WWI, the weakest link was the religious divide in Austria-Hungary. Over the course of a number of "Balkan crises," the Eastern Orthodox Serbs and Bosnians in southern Austria-Hungary grew discontent with the Roman Catholic Dual Monarchy that ruled the Habsburg empire--soon to be Austria-Hungary. As the Ottoman empire declined, the Serbs marked Bosnia as their own and were infuriated when Austria annexed Bosnia in 1908. When a the Balkan wars saw Austria cut Serbia off from the sea, Serbs both independent and Austrian grew exasperated and desperate. (Reader page 6 CITE)
	This chain of events was driven by recent level three influences: the ongoing security-dilemma-induced arms race had Germany's neighbors scrambling for land and power. States and citizens alike were expecting war, and looking to gain as much of an upper hand as possible before it broke out.</span></p><p><span>	level 3 -> level 1: individual actions cause stuff

Without a change of level three incentives, such as a global mediator or mutually assured destruction, shifting power dynamics and the cult of the offensive will lead inescapably to security-dilemma-induced arms race and growing tensions which cause nationalist viewponts and breed rash individuals. Thus, international disincentives like mutually assured destruction are key to keeping political and economic incentives from inflaming ideological divides and causing warfare.</span></p></section></div></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="todos"><span
