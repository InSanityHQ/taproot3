  the Indochina conflict in 1946-1954 and over the Algerian liberation
  struggle in 1954-1962 toward a partial alignment of views." AA</span></p></li><li><p><span>"It was the shared uneasiness over the deteriorating situation in
  Vietnam and over the Limited Test Ban Treaty (LTBT), signed by the
  United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union in Moscow in
  early August 1963, that helped to usher in the process of
  recognition." AB</span></p></li><li><p><span>A five point reason for establishment of relationships as argued by
  historian historian Garret Martin L1</span></p><ol><li><p><span>"First, the end of the Algerian War in the spring of 1962 removed a
     major point of Sino-French conflict." L1A</span></p></li><li><p><span>"Second, the Cuban missile crisis in October ofthe same year
     revealed that neither superpower wanted global war. In turn, this
     provided new opportunities for medium powers to follow independent
     policies." L1B</span></p></li><li><p><span>"Third, Sino-French recognition was a natural follow-up to de
     Gaulle's attempts to break Anglo-American dominance in the West in
     early 1963 through the Franco-German treaty." L1C</span></p></li><li><p><span>"Fourth, de Gaulle perceived the LTBT of August 1963 as an attack
     on French global interests." L1D</span></p></li><li><p><span>"Finally, the political instability in South Vietnam in 1963
     brought China and France to agree in their criticism of Ngo Dinh
     Diem's regime." L1E</span></p></li></ol></li><li><p><span>"The shared nuclear isolation and the partial agreement on Vietnam in
  August 1963 by Beijing and Paris symbolized a new stage in the
  trajectory oftheir mutual relationship from antagonism toward mutual
  recognition" AC</span></p></li><li><p><span>"From the day the PRC was founded in the fall of 1949, it had striven
  for universal diplomatic recognition. Not only did this policy express
  the old nationalist aim ofrestoring China to its former glory and
  greatness in international relations; it also conveyed the aspiration
  ofthe Communist leaders to obtain recognition from non-Communist
  states, based on the “principles of equality"” AD</span></p></li><li><p><span>"The PRC explicitly warned the Soviet Union against assuming legal
  “responsibilities in lieu of China. Even now, decades after the
  signing of the LTBT, Chinese publications still claim that the treaty
  deprived the PRC ofthe right to develop and test nuclear weapons." AE</span></p></li><li><p><span>"President John F. Kennedy, who feared the Chinese acquisition
  ofnuclear weapons in 1962-1963, was at times more interested in the
  proliferation aspects of the treaty than in the banning of testing in
  multiple environments" AF</span></p></li><li><p><span>"De Gaulle was highly critical of the LTBT. In reality, however,
  France was not affected by the accord s provisions. The underground
  tests it was conducting in Algeria were permitted by the
  Soviet-British-American pact as the only way to test nuclear weapons.
  But the French president saw the trilateral agreement as yet another
  Yalta-style deal among the three most powerful countries on earth,
  concluded behind the backs ofless powerful states, and designed to
  preserve the three great powers' preeminent status in international
  relations" AE</span></p></li><li><p><span>"Even if France and the PRC disagreed on the future course with regard
  to Vietnam, they both believed in the necessity of U.S. political and
  military withdrawal from the country" AF</span></p></li><li><p><span>"The desire for recognition by the outside world also included the
  wish to join the UN and, as the ultimate goal, to take up the
  permanent seat ofthe ROC on the UN Security Council." AG</span></p></li><li><p><span>"The PRC took pains to express its interest in better relations
  through some of its highest officials present at the Laos conference
  in Geneva." AH</span></p></li><li><p><span>"The French ambassador had the strong impression that the PRC wanted
  to give the mutual relationship a “new importance." The Chinese had
  extended a hand, and they believed it was now up to the French to
  accept it.” AI</span></p></li><li><p><span>"[Mao's] statement signified a departure from his earlier thinking on
  intermediate zones, which envisioned a Europe divided in halves
  belonging to either the socialist or the capitalist camp. But what did
  Maos new intermediate zone in Europe really mean? He claimed that the
  European countries were “unhappy with the U.S. and the Soviet Union."
  AJ</span></p></li><li><p><span>"As the LTBT negotiations in Moscow drew to a close---the concurrent
  Sino-Soviet party-to-party talks in that city, which were intended to
  bring about ideological reconciliation, had already ended in failure"
  AK</span></p></li><li><p><span>The French Foreign Ministry Asia Department Communique: "Asia
  Department ofthe French Foreign Ministry prepared a report in early
  February 1961 advocating rapprochement with Communist China---for
  reasons of principle and practicality." L2</span></p><ul><li><p><span>"The Chinese Communists had held de facto power over mainland China
    for more than ten years. The notion that the ROC in Taiwan ... was
    the legal representative of the Chinese people ... had long before
    turned out to be a fiction." L2A</span></p></li><li><p><span>"Since the end of the Indochina War in 1954---and despite the
    Algerian war---France and the PRC ... no longer had any reason to be
    antagonistic toward each other." L2B</span></p></li><li><p><span>"Because many newly independent French colonies in Africa were
    gravitating toward recognition ofmainland China, France had to
    appear to lead them in recognizing the PRC, otherwise it would lose
    influence in Africa." L2C</span></p></li><li><p><span>"Finally, Communist China had become the most important French
    trading partner in East Asia." L2D</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><span>"He explicitly remarked that the LTBT did not prevent the PRC or
  France from continuing nuclear testing. Expecting an imminent Chinese
  nuclear test, de Gaulle elaborated that once China had obtained
  nuclear capacities it would become a major actor in international
  relations." AL</span></p></li><li><p><span>"Zhou concluded that the Sino-Soviet split and the temporary
  U.S.-Soviet rapprochement on nuclear issues had created the basis for
  a major rearrangement in international relations, which would
  logically include Sino-French rapprochement." AM</span></p></li><li><p><span>So why did Zhou decide this was a good idea? L3</span></p><ul><li><p><span>They "believed that rapprochement with the most important European
    continental power, France, would progressively lead to increased
    political and economic relations with other West European countries,
    which in turn would break the U.S. economic blockade ofthe PRC while
    simultaneously increasing China's international status." L3A</span></p></li><li><p><span>"Sino-French rapprochement would be beneficial in isolating and
    opposing U.S. imperialism on a global scale." L3B</span></p></li><li><p><span>"Finally, China could align with France's policy of national
    independence designed to break the superpower monopoly in
    international relations." L3C</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><span>"As de Gaulle saw it, France was willing to work for the admission
  ofthe PRC to the UN and to scale down French- Taiwanese relations to
  an informal level, but it was not willing to offer a French initiative
  to break relations with the ROC." AN</span></p></li><li><p><span>"De Gaulle wanted both to proceed cautiously and to portray France as
  a great power unwilling to sub- mit to the dictates of any other
  country." AO</span></p></li><li><p><span>"Zhou lauded France's decision to grant Algeria independence the year
  before and commented on the fact that both France and China, as
  aspiring nuclear powers, opposed the LTBT." AP</span></p></li><li><p><span>"Zhou attempted to bring up the One-China principle, whereas Faure
  demanded the exclusion ofthe issue from this preliminary session." AQ</span></p></li><li><p><span>"Faure insisted that de Gaulle would never take the initiative in
  breaking relations, so he suggested that France and the PRC simply
  exchange ambassadors, while the French govern- ment would downgrade
  the ROC representation in Paris to a level to be specified later." AR</span></p></li><li><p><span>"The situation in Indochina had deteriorated further; the relations
  ofGreat Britain and the United States---France's two competitors for
  global influence---with the Southeast Asian countries had worsened in
  parallel."” AU</span></p></li><li><p><span>"De Gaulle parted from Faure with the comment that he would go through
  with French recognition of the PRC if his conversations in Washington
  did not change U.S. views.... deGaulle's encounters with Johnson did
  not go well." AV</span></p></li><li><p><span>"DeGaulle instructed deBeaumarchais ... only"to define a procedure:
  /the simpler the better/”” AW</span></p></li><li><p><span>"Zhou proposed a fourth procedure in case France was not able to agree
  to the One-China prin ciple. In that case, Li should state the Chinese
  position on the issue but not insist on the inclusion ofa sentence to
  that effect in any draft joint communique. ... de Beaumarchais
  insisted that France would not agree to any reference to the One-China
  principle in the joint communique. Li, following the instructions he
  had received, dropped the issue" AX</span></p></li><li><p><span>"if deBeaumarchais insisted on France maintaining a Two-China policy,
  Li was supposed to state clearly that such a position would mean a
  departure from earlier French positions and a sign ofdisrespect to the
  PRC, but Zhou's instructions did </span><em><span>not</span></em><span> call for a termination
  ofnegotiations in such a case" AY</span></p></li><li><p><span>"De Gaulle's insistence on a simple text left the agreement vague with
  regard to the ROC on Taiwan." AZ</span></p></li><li><p><span>So why did deGaull think this was such a good idea? L4</span></p><ul><li><p><span>"He stated that China was the world's largest country, that it was
    no longer under the control ofthe Soviet Union, that its Communist
    government was a fact of life, and that all “political realities" of
    Asia” L4A</span></p></li><li><p><span>"Thus, he continued, it would be absolutely “impossible" to envision
    a solution to the problems ofEast Asia without China” L4B</span></p></li><li><p><span>"de Gaulle also stressed that recognition of the PRC entailed
    approval of neither its institutions nor its policies" L4C</span></p></li></ul></li></ul></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="claim-synthesis"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Claim Synthesis</span></span></h2><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="the-claim"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>The Claim</span></span></h3><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-4"><h4 class="firn-headline firn-headline-4" id="scholarly-view"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Scholarly View</span></span></h4><section><ul><li><p><span>AA France and China moved away from military political conflict and
