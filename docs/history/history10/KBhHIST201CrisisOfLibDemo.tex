\section{Crisis of Liberal Democracy}
\label{sec:org1d1a15a}
\begin{itemize}
\item When unifying crisises occur
\item When police and millitary becomes over-controlling
\item When an individual seizes power by force without remediation from
constitution
\item When a party becomes uniformly controlling of the government without
competition
\item When central tenants of demcracy were extrinsically distrubed
\item When promises go unchecked or undelivered
\item When popular support becomes undefeated
\end{itemize}

Liquitity crisis: elements of mobile society becomes fix/stuck

\subsection{Agricultural Crisis}
\label{sec:org58c8d74}
\begin{itemize}
\item Agriculture requires the ability to take debt: that you need money to
plant, and you get return in the end
\item During a system of overproduction, governments has to "pay people not
to work." Meaning, governments like the US had to buy up supply and
start burning them.
\item Western nations, during the agricultural crisis

\begin{itemize}
\item Protectionism
\item Tightening credit/payback
\item Diversion of bubles => anarchic response in global markets: every
country trying to protect themselves and hence hurting the
collective
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Amercian Financing}
\label{sec:org92cd2df}
\begin{itemize}
\item US funds attempted to force German industrial expansion and recovery
\item Governments, using this fund, tries to legitamate themselves by
stimulating inflation and creating fancy things
\end{itemize}

"The New Deal Programs" => some say that there is a hinderance to the
economy

Instead of having money go into the economy, US credit system caused
"speculative bubbles": bubbles that are caused by traders speculating
individuals' will to buy something. i.e.Â Florida real estate + stock
markets.

Margin trading began: a lot of investors are making a bubble through
margins.

John Keens proposes that captalism is not self-regulating because of the
humanistic, animalistic emotions within the marget.

\subsection{Tom's Depression Vortex}
\label{sec:org2d77256}
Crisis of liquitity and underconsumption structural crisis

\begin{itemize}
\item Factories close down, workers laid off
\item Poverty => lower demand for both consumer goods and food
\item People with lower demand deciedes that they are better off buying more
things
\item Factories will then buy less
\item Repeat sadness
\end{itemize}

Depression began as a fundimental crisis for western style democracy

\subsection{Fashism}
\label{sec:orgfe98b37}
\begin{itemize}
\item Rejection of material economy
\item Rejects the "lots of money to buy things" goal
\item Accepts life as a hero's struggle: that one thing --- the all-powerful
state --- should unlock the heroism in other people
\end{itemize}

In times of chaos, clear central control is needed from current
government.

When traditional conservatives decide that radical conservatives are
"Generally Acceptable", societies collapse and power wil move to the
"wild side".

Desperate people are easy picking are demagogues. So to enable global
peace, make people less desperate.
