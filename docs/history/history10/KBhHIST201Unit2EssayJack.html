as Kissinger puts it, limit conflict and produce the "best possible
outcome" from flawed human nature? Or did it magnify conflict and
increase the likelihood of global war?</span></p><p><span>## Quotable Quotes</span></p><ul><li><p><span>Kissinger</span></p><ul><li><p><span>"If the circumstances were reversed, we could equally be pro-German
    and anti-French." A1</span></p></li><li><p><span>"William was perfectly willing to negotiate with Louis XIV when he
    felt the balance of power could best be served by doing so." A2</span></p></li><li><p><span>"Agreeing on the importance of the balance of power did not,
    however, still British disputes about the best strategy to implement
    the policy. ... The Whigs argued that GB should engage only when
    balance threatened, and only long enough to remove threat; Tories
    argued that GB's duty was to </span><em><span>shape</span></em><span> the balance of power." A3</span></p></li><li><p><span>CLAIM: "Of course, in the end a balance of power always comes about
    de facto when several states interact." A4</span></p></li><li><p><span>"Power is too difficult to assess, and the willingness to vindicate
    it too various, to permit treating it as a reliable guide to
    international order. ... The balance of power inhibits the capacity
    to overthrow the international order" A5</span></p></li><li><p><span>"Every king consoled himself with the thought that strengthening his
    own rule was the greatest possible contribution to the general
    peace, and left it to the ubiquitous invisible hand to justify his
    exertions - without limiting his ambitions." A6</span></p></li><li><p><span>"But Louis XN gained no peace. of mind from security; he saw in it
    an opportunity for conquest. In his overzealous pursuit of raison
    d'etat, LouisXN alarmed the rest of Europe and brought together an
    anti-French coalition which, in the end, thwarted his design." A7</span></p></li><li><p><span>"Thereby, France lost the advantage of having adversaries
    constrained by moral considerations ... Once all states played by
    the same rules, gains became much more difficult to achieve" A8</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><span>Roberts</span></p><ul><li><p><span>"In the next four centuries, Christianity was often to have
    disastrous effects. Confident in the possession of the true
    religion, Europeans were impatient and contemptuous of the values
    and achievements of the peoples and civilizations they disturbed."
    A9</span></p></li><li><p><span>"Greed quickly led to the abuse of power, to domination and
    exploitation by force. In the end this led to great crimes - though
    they were often committed unconsciously." A10</span></p></li><li><p><span>"Europeans could usually exact what they wanted in the end because
    of a technical superiority which exaggerated the power of their tiny
    numbers and for a few centuries turned the balance against the great
    historic agglomerations of population and civilization." A11</span></p></li><li><p><span>"The obscuring of the Company's primary commercial role was not good
    for business. It also gave its employees even greater opportunities
    to feather their own nests. ... the British government hoped as
    fervently as the Company to avoid being dragged any further into the
    role of imperial power in India." A12</span></p></li><li><p><span>"The huge and growing Caribbean market for slaves and imported
    European goods was added to that already offered by a Spanish empire
    increasingly unable to defend its economic monopoly. This fixed the
    role of the West Indies in the relationships of the European powers
    for the next century. ... They were long a prey to disorder" A13</span></p></li><li><p><span>"Gradually, the great powers fought out their disputes until they
    arrived at acceptable agreements, but this was to take a long time."
    A14</span></p></li><li><p><span>"All the colonial powers had, by the eighteenth century, been able
    to extract some economic profit from their colonies" A15</span></p></li><li><p><span>"Europeans did not just conquer; they exterminated local cultures
    and peoples and replaced them with their own" A16</span></p></li><li><p><span>"Older cultures were to be cut off from populating the new worlds or
    setting their mark on them" A17</span></p></li><li><p><span>"The French were Great Britain's most dangerous potential
    competitors, but their government was always likely to be distracted
    by its European continental commitments." A18</span></p></li><li><p><span>"The British lacked missionary zeal ... they had no immediate urge
    to interfere with the native custom or institution" A19</span></p></li><li><p><span>"Before its outbreak, there had in fact been no remission of
    fighting in India, even while France and Great Britain were
    officially at peace after 1748." A20</span></p></li><li><p><span>"The possession of a station at Calcutta placed them at the door to
    that part of India which was potentially the richest prize - Bengal
    and the lower Ganges valley." A21</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><span>Mason</span></p><ul><li><p><span>"A long struggle between Parliament and the Stuart kings [in
    England?] and essentially replaced the absolute monarchy with a
    constitutional monarchy" A22</span></p></li><li><p><span>"'Sovereign power resides in my person alone .... It is from me
    alone that my policies take their existence and their authority'"
    A23</span></p></li><li><p><span>"European monarchies had consciously pursued a policy of the balance
    of power, a system of shifting international alliances that
    prevented any one country from becoming too powerful" A24</span></p></li><li><p><span>"Wars were fought not so much for ideology or nationalism but to
    maintain the balance of power ... The victor did not want to crush
    the vanquished" A25</span></p></li><li><p><span>"Napoleon formed mass armies and led them into other countries to
    spread the ideas of the Revolution and to enhance his own power" A26</span></p></li><li><p><span>"The French Revolution and the Napoleonic wars had unleashed forces
    that would shake the foundations of European society." A27</span></p></li><li><p><span>"Napoleon had changed the nature of warfare in Europe by
    conscripting huge armies and infusing them with a commitment to
    fight for France and for 'liberty, equality, and fraternity,' the
    slogan of the Revolution." A28</span></p></li><li><p><span>"The victor did not want to crush the vanquished, as this would
    upset the balance; in any case, the defeated state might be a future
    ally." A29</span></p></li><li><p><span>"Louis XVIII issued a constitutional charter that incorporated many
    of the changes that had entered into French life and society since
    1789" A30</span></p></li><li><p><span>"An inefficient system of taxation made it difficult for the
    monarchy to raise the money it needed. ... Between 1726 and 1789,
    the cost of living increased by 62 percent, whereas wages rose by
    only 25 percent." A31</span></p></li><li><p><span>"Napoleon's military fortunes began to wane ... The allied armies
    pressed on, entered Paris, and forced Napoleon to abdicate" A32</span></p></li><li><p><span>"By giving free rein to individual greed and the private
    accumulation of wealth, the"invisible hand” of the market would
    benefit society in the end” A37</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><span>Our Surprise Friend Kennedy</span></p><ul><li><p><span>Europe had always been politically fragmented, despite even the best
    efforts of the Romans A33 => Europe is politically fragmented</span></p></li><li><p><span>For this political diversity Europe had largely to thank its
    geography. There were no enormous plains over which an empire of
    horse men could impose its swift dominion; nor were there broad and
    fertile zones ... providing the food for masses of toiling and
    easily conquerable peasants A34 => Europe is A33 because of its
    unique geography</span></p></li><li><p><span>The fact was that in Europe there were always some princes and local
    lords willing to tolerate merchants and their ways even when others
    plundered and expelled them A35 => Europe had mixed variety of local
    ideals that often conflicted with each other</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><span>Trauttmann, another big surprise</span></p><ul><li><p><span>The Company had in fact aimed at territorial dominion, following the
    Dutch mode A36 => In India, England (the Mediator!) elected to
