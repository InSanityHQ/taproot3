<p>
 In the end, did the European balance of power succeed in its goal to,
as Kissinger puts it, limit conflict and produce the "best possible
outcome" from flawed human nature? Or did it magnify conflict and
increase the likelihood of global war?

## Quotable Quotes
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Kissinger

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>"If the circumstances were reversed, we could equally be pro-German
and anti-French." A1</li>
<li>"William was perfectly willing to negotiate with Louis XIV when he
felt the balance of power could best be served by doing so." A2</li>
<li>"Agreeing on the importance of the balance of power did not,
however, still British disputes about the best strategy to implement
the policy. &#x2026; The Whigs argued that GB should engage only when
balance threatened, and only long enough to remove threat; Tories
argued that GB's duty was to <i>shape</i> the balance of power." A3</li>
<li>CLAIM: "Of course, in the end a balance of power always comes about
de facto when several states interact." A4</li>
<li>"Power is too difficult to assess, and the willingness to vindicate
it too various, to permit treating it as a reliable guide to
international order. &#x2026; The balance of power inhibits the capacity
to overthrow the international order" A5</li>
<li>"Every king consoled himself with the thought that strengthening his
own rule was the greatest possible contribution to the general
peace, and left it to the ubiquitous invisible hand to justify his
exertions - without limiting his ambitions." A6</li>
<li>"But Louis XN gained no peace. of mind from security; he saw in it
an opportunity for conquest. In his overzealous pursuit of raison
d'etat, LouisXN alarmed the rest of Europe and brought together an
anti-French coalition which, in the end, thwarted his design." A7</li>
<li>"Thereby, France lost the advantage of having adversaries
constrained by moral considerations &#x2026; Once all states played by
the same rules, gains became much more difficult to achieve" A8</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Roberts

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>"In the next four centuries, Christianity was often to have
disastrous effects. Confident in the possession of the true
religion, Europeans were impatient and contemptuous of the values
and achievements of the peoples and civilizations they disturbed."
A9</li>
<li>"Greed quickly led to the abuse of power, to domination and
exploitation by force. In the end this led to great crimes - though
they were often committed unconsciously." A10</li>
<li>"Europeans could usually exact what they wanted in the end because
of a technical superiority which exaggerated the power of their tiny
numbers and for a few centuries turned the balance against the great
historic agglomerations of population and civilization." A11</li>
<li>"The obscuring of the Company's primary commercial role was not good
for business. It also gave its employees even greater opportunities
to feather their own nests. &#x2026; the British government hoped as
fervently as the Company to avoid being dragged any further into the
role of imperial power in India." A12</li>
<li>"The huge and growing Caribbean market for slaves and imported
European goods was added to that already offered by a Spanish empire
increasingly unable to defend its economic monopoly. This fixed the
role of the West Indies in the relationships of the European powers
for the next century. &#x2026; They were long a prey to disorder" A13</li>
<li>"Gradually, the great powers fought out their disputes until they
arrived at acceptable agreements, but this was to take a long time."
A14</li>
<li>"All the colonial powers had, by the eighteenth century, been able
to extract some economic profit from their colonies" A15</li>
<li>"Europeans did not just conquer; they exterminated local cultures
and peoples and replaced them with their own" A16</li>
<li>"Older cultures were to be cut off from populating the new worlds or
setting their mark on them" A17</li>
<li>"The French were Great Britain's most dangerous potential
competitors, but their government was always likely to be distracted
by its European continental commitments." A18</li>
<li>"The British lacked missionary zeal &#x2026; they had no immediate urge
to interfere with the native custom or institution" A19</li>
<li>"Before its outbreak, there had in fact been no remission of
fighting in India, even while France and Great Britain were
officially at peace after 1748." A20</li>
<li>"The possession of a station at Calcutta placed them at the door to
that part of India which was potentially the richest prize - Bengal
and the lower Ganges valley." A21</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Mason

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>"A long struggle between Parliament and the Stuart kings [in
England?] and essentially replaced the absolute monarchy with a
constitutional monarchy" A22</li>
<li>"'Sovereign power resides in my person alone &#x2026;. It is from me
alone that my policies take their existence and their authority'"
A23</li>
<li>"European monarchies had consciously pursued a policy of the balance
of power, a system of shifting international alliances that
prevented any one country from becoming too powerful" A24</li>
<li>"Wars were fought not so much for ideology or nationalism but to
maintain the balance of power &#x2026; The victor did not want to crush
the vanquished" A25</li>
<li>"Napoleon formed mass armies and led them into other countries to
spread the ideas of the Revolution and to enhance his own power" A26</li>
<li>"The French Revolution and the Napoleonic wars had unleashed forces
that would shake the foundations of European society." A27</li>
<li>"Napoleon had changed the nature of warfare in Europe by
conscripting huge armies and infusing them with a commitment to
fight for France and for 'liberty, equality, and fraternity,' the
slogan of the Revolution." A28</li>
<li>"The victor did not want to crush the vanquished, as this would
upset the balance; in any case, the defeated state might be a future
ally." A29</li>
<li>"Louis XVIII issued a constitutional charter that incorporated many
of the changes that had entered into French life and society since
1789" A30</li>
<li>"An inefficient system of taxation made it difficult for the
monarchy to raise the money it needed. &#x2026; Between 1726 and 1789,
the cost of living increased by 62 percent, whereas wages rose by
only 25 percent." A31</li>
<li>"Napoleon's military fortunes began to wane &#x2026; The allied armies
pressed on, entered Paris, and forced Napoleon to abdicate" A32</li>
<li>"By giving free rein to individual greed and the private
accumulation of wealth, the"invisible hand” of the market would
benefit society in the end” A37</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Our Surprise Friend Kennedy

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Europe had always been politically fragmented, despite even the best
efforts of the Romans A33 =&gt; Europe is politically fragmented</li>
<li>For this political diversity Europe had largely to thank its
geography. There were no enormous plains over which an empire of
horse men could impose its swift dominion; nor were there broad and
fertile zones &#x2026; providing the food for masses of toiling and
easily conquerable peasants A34 =&gt; Europe is A33 because of its
unique geography</li>
<li>The fact was that in Europe there were always some princes and local
lords willing to tolerate merchants and their ways even when others
plundered and expelled them A35 =&gt; Europe had mixed variety of local
ideals that often conflicted with each other</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Trauttmann, another big surprise

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The Company had in fact aimed at territorial dominion, following the
Dutch mode A36 =&gt; In India, England (the Mediator!) elected to
control land instead of doing balance-of-power</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Balance of power only encourages fighting when provoked</li>

<li>Entropy, so people provoke</li>

<li>But ultimately its more stable than old world empires</li>

<li>It encourages fighting, but that's unavoidable

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Competing resources</li>
<li>Competing land</li>
<li>Competing trade</li>
</ul></li>

<li>BOP naturally create conflict</li>

<li>But these conflicts are still better/necessary than normal war</li>

/Although the European balance of power does lead to frequent
competitive conflict &#x2014; like that between France and England &#x2014; it
ultimately is both naturally unavoidable and the best outcome for
generally peaceful international policy/
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>To BOP conflict is needed

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We got to our current Euro-centric world b/c European nations,
through leveraging its technical superiority, upset the balance of
power in acient countries A11</li>
<li>They did they b/c our good friend Raison de etat. Every king
believes that acting in his self intrest strengthened general peace
A6, but greed lead to unconcious crimes A10</li>
<li>Indeed, too many countries Raisoning may lead to countries
unrestrained by morality A8 to achieve the bestest they could</li>
<li>But to actually achieve "the best", we need to constantly adjust the
balance:

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Before the 7 years war, Britian and France still fought even
nominally at peace A20</li>
<li>all the colonial powers had, by the eighteenth century, been able
to extract some economic profit from their colonies A15</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>

<li>Why so much conflict? =&gt; conflict = balance readjustment

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>No agreement? Fight! Eventually there will be one. A14</li>
<li>Because europeans intentionally set up goverment to prevent one from
being too powerful A24</li>
<li>What adjustments? Tracing Napolean:

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>France was baaad: A31</li>
<li>The Enlightment happpened (need quote?) Which seeks to BOP

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>French Rev shaked europe A27</li>
<li>napolean tried to spread ideas of the revolution A26</li>
<li>How did he fade? He got balance-of-powered A32 again b/c he was
being too good at this emperor-not-an-emperor thing.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>

<li>It's fine, because its natural

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Napoleon example Net positive? Hard to tell. But! At that time, this
was natural and inevitable: we got from Louis to Louis, but it is
from A31 Louis to A30 better Louis</li>
<li>Competition in French and English colony in India often set aside
for mainland competition A18, why? because of colonized land having
A34 unique resources that make them easier to control

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A33 Europe has always been geographically fragmented, so one has
to keep fighting to maintain balance</li>
<li>A35: in Europe, no unified ideas and hence constant fighting, but
not in conquered places, which were mostly (and easily) controlled
