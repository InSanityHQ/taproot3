be analyzed at three different levels: the individual human level, the
state level, and the international system level. Those who view things
from the first level believe that war is best explained by
"selfishness," "misdirected aggressive impulses," or "stupidity" within
the human psyche. Those who favor the second level believe there are
hostile or aggressive or revisionist states who, because of their form
of government or other domestic issues, behave in a warlike manner while
other states simply want to keep the peace (the status quo). Those who
favor the third level believe that the international system itself,
because it is an anarchy with "no system of law enforceable" between
states, and in which each state acts according to its own interest and
reserves the right to use force to achieve its aims, makes war
inevitable.</span></p><p><span>*Analyze World War 1 according to one (or a blend) of these levels of
analysis. Make an argument that combines an explanation of the general
causes of the war with the specific sequence of events (including events
that prolonged the war beyond the initial outbreak).*</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="thought-bucket"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Thought Bucket</span></span></h2><section><ul><li><p><span>Formation of alliances?</span></p></li><li><p><span>The wish for peace is a cause or an effect?</span></p></li><li><p><span>Goverments</span></p></li></ul><p><span>Self-interested </span><span> compromises with other parties causes
