      Serbian secret soci ety called "Union of Death" and commonly known
      as the Black Hand, acting with the knowledge of certain Serbian
      officials, assassinated the heir to the Habsburg empire, the
      Archduke Francis Ferdinand,</span></p></li><li><p><span>states</span></p><ul><li><p><span>and above</span></p></li><li><p><span>The Germans, issuing their famous "blank check," encouraged the
        Austrians to be firm.</span></p></li><li><p><span>The Austrians, thus reassured, dispatched a drastic ultimatum to
        Serbia, demanding among other things that Austrian officials be
        permitted to collaborate in investigating and punishing the
        perpetrators of the assassination.</span></p></li><li><p><span>The Serbs counted on Russian support, even to the point of war,
        judging that Russia could not yield in a Balkan crisis, for the
        third time in six years, without losing its influence in the
        Balkans altogether.</span></p></li><li><p><span>The Russians in turn counted on France; and France, terrified at
        the possibility of being some day caught alone in a war with
        Germany and determined to keep Russia as an ally at any cost, in
        effect gave a blank check to Russia.</span></p></li><li><p><span>It has often been said that had the German government know as a
        positive fact that England would fight, the war might not have
        come. Hence the evasiveness of British policy is made a
        contributing cause of the war.</span></p></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p><span>tension and alliances</span></p><ul><li><p><span>triple alliance</span></p><ul><li><p><span>The Germans complained of being "encircled" by France and Russia.
      They dreaded the day when they might have to face a war on two
      fronts.\\</span></p></li><li><p><span>Bismarck after 1871 feared that in another European war his new
      German Empire might be tom to pieces. [...] in 1879 he formed a
      military alliance with Austria-Hungary, to which Italy was added
      in 1882. Thus was formed the Triple Alliance,</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><span>triple entente</span></p><ul><li><p><span>The French, faced by the Triple Alliance, soon seized the
      opportunity to form their own alliance with Russia</span></p></li><li><p><span>By 1907 Eng land, France, and Russia were acting together. The
      older Triple Alliance faced a newer Triple Entente,</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><span>tension</span></p><ul><li><p><span>that would arise in the future. Each power felt that it must stand
      by its allies whatever the specific issue. This was because all
      lived in the fear of war, of some nameless future war in which
      allies would be necessary.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Never had the European states maintained such huge armies in
      peacetime as at the be ginning of the twentieth century. One, two,
      or even three years of compul sory military service for all young
      men became the rule. In 1914 each of the Continental Great Powers
      had not only a huge standing army but millions of trained reserves

alliances shifted the local minima from peace to global warfare.</span></p><p><span>analyzing individul actors in a broader system</span></p><p><span>While many individual actors could be blamed, analysis at this level is
not useful for understanding causation.</span></p><p><span>The assassination of Franz Ferdinand caused World War One. In 1914, a
Serbian member of the Black Hand "assassinated the heir to the Hapsburg
empire." (citation). This murder caused the Austrian government to try
and end Serbia's independence; global warfare ensued. However, for the
assassination of Ferdinand to cause such a large scale event, larger
factors must have been at play. The situation was akin to an egg sitting
in a busy highway -- at some point, the egg will get cracked. Yes, the
driver who runs the egg over caused it to crack, but a deeper and more
useful understanding of causation comes from analyzing the situation
rather than the one of many possible drivers. At a higher level of
removal, it could be argued that Serbia was the cause of the war, as the
assassin was "acting with the knowledge of certain Serbian
officials."(citation). Or perhaps it was Austria, who issued a "drastic
ultimatum to Serbia." (citation). But Austria only did so after Germany
delivered "their famous 'blank check,' encourag[ing] the Austrians to be
firm."(citation). Trying to determine which point in this causational
chain truly led to World War One is a fruitless exercise, as the fact of
the matter is, "in the last years before 1914 the idea [was] that war
was bound to break out sooner or later" -- and this wasn't due to one
meddling state (citation).</span></p><p><span>To better understand the cause of the war, we must first understand the
geopolitical situation at the time -- a time of growing alliances and
tensions. In 1817, the fear of warfare led Germany to form "a military
alliance with Austria-Hungary, to which Italy was added in 1882."
(citation). This alliance led to the creation of another; faced by this
new threat, France allied with Russia, and later, England. Tension only
grew, as Germany "who already felt encircled by the alliance of France
and Russia, naturally watched with concern the drift of England into the
Franco-Russian camp."(citation). The Continental Great Powers were now
riddled with alliances. These alliances contributed to the massive
amount of tension, evident by the "huge standing army" and "millions of
trained reserves among the civilian population" of each Continental
Great Power. (citation). This tension created a feeling of impending
war, "in which allies would be necessary." (citation). This feeling
tightened existing alliances and led to the creation of new ones, in
turn contributing to even greater tension. Alliances formed, tension
grew, and the with this change the local minima began to shift. { could
mention: Massive industrial and economic growth }</span></p><p><span>The emergent property from raison d'etat changes from a balance of power
to large scale conflict when alliances and tension are introduced. A
system of states all enacting raison d'etat is known to lead to a
balance of power, as when any one state gains power, the others act in
their own best interest and crush the rising state. Out of pure self
interest arises peace. We can represent this scenario with a payoff
matrix -- two actors, each with two possible actions: attack or defend.
If both states defend, they each get a score of two. If both attack,
they each lose resources, and any power gained would be crushed; each
state gets a zero. If one state attacks while the other defends, the
same scenario occurs. In this case, defending is clearly the best
action. However, as alliances form, this payoff matrix changes. If an
alliance attacks, it becomes much more likely that they will reap a
reward, as crushing them requires an alliance of equal or greater size.
If one doesn't form, the alliance gets a score of three, and the
defending party a zero. Thus, larger alliances form as a preemptive
measure. This alliance formation then starts a sort of snowball effect.
For any insider -- an attacking or defending party -- the best course of
action would be to try and recruit more allies. One side is expected to
win, and effectively gain the power of their fallen foes. And hence,
outsiders, if the war is sufficiently large, must join the fray lest
they be left in the dust with their old divided power level. The global
minima has shifted. The emergent property from raison d'etat is no
longer peace but rather large-scale warfare.</span></p><ul><li><p><span>raison d'etat leads to balance of power</span></p><ul><li><p><span>states all crush others when they gain power cus it's their best
