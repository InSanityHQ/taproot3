\section{Notes}
\label{sec:org2e4098d}
\subsection{Prologue}
\label{sec:org9cbbad9}
\begin{itemize}
\item Usually conquest of America is viewed from a Western (Eurocentric)
perspective, but we should look at it also from a \textbf{Native American
perspective}
\item This isn't easy because Native Americans didn't really write stuff
down
\item Text will look at how we might actually do this
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Ch 2}
\label{sec:orgdceca24}
\begin{itemize}
\item European settlement didn't seem so significant in the 16th and early
17th century

\begin{itemize}
\item Rivalries between tribes, etc. seemed more important
\end{itemize}

\item Consequences of European settlement

\begin{itemize}
\item Environmental changes that were bad for Indians
\item Cultural changes
\item Spreading of microbes
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Pattern of settlements}
\label{sec:orgc13b21c}
\begin{itemize}
\item Spanish settlement in southeast (e.g.Â Florida)
\item Basque, French, English fishing from Newfoundland to Cape Cod

\begin{itemize}
\item Some made semi-permanent camps which acted as trading camps
\end{itemize}

\item English in Chesapeake Bay, settled Jamestown 1607
\item French build Quebec in Stadacona 1608
\item Henry Hudson explores Hudson river 1609
\item Large European companies start settling in areas
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{European settlements lead to importing of European objects}
\label{sec:org2c8b582}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Trading system created}
\item Some European manufacturers made items for Indians or took Indian
items and made them into European objects
\item Raw materials were important; metal items were valued by what they
were made from rather than function
\item Indians only started using European goods as they were intended after
large colonies were settled
\item European goods were valuable to Indians as well as European settlers
and improved quality of life
\item Some Indian culture shaped itself around European objects / absorbed
European culture
\item Weapons were much better

\begin{itemize}
\item Ofc guns were cool
\item Metal blades had much greater impact initially
\item Arms race among Indian tribes

\begin{itemize}
\item Stabilized after enough European colony settlements (200 years)
\end{itemize}

\item Guns sought after after arms race stabilization

\begin{itemize}
\item Policies in place to prevent trade to Indians, but trade happened
anyways because of economic incentive
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\item Beaver hunting and traps

\begin{itemize}
\item Beaver pelts were very, \textbf{very} important
\item Beaver hunting reshaped political power

\begin{itemize}
\item Intertribal and intratribal politics shifted from beaver pelts \#\#\#
Environmental changes
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\item Demand for beavers led to overhunting led to regional extinctions

\begin{itemize}
\item Didn't impact beaver populations in the long term
\item Impacted environment significantly
\end{itemize}

\item Use of land differed between Indians and European settlers

\begin{itemize}
\item Land as "resource" (Indian) vs "commodity" (European)
\item Indian farming productivity was significant

\begin{itemize}
\item Diversity in plants (corn, beans, squash, etc)
\end{itemize}

\item North America lacked farmable animals
\item Deforestation and pasture creation for domesticated farm animals by
Europeans

\begin{itemize}
\item Restricted Native American lifestyles
\item Pigs, Chickens, etc. stole resources away from wild animals \#\#\#
Disease introduction
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\item Crap ton of impact in the form of deaths, even in early days of
settlement
\item Problem worsened from family migrations to North America
\item Disease decreased labor output by Natives

\begin{itemize}
\item Created many socioeconomic problems
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Conclusion}
\label{sec:orga7a03c6}
\textbf{Native Americans were dynamic and adapted to changing environment}

\section{Summary of Reading}
\label{sec:org89ad670}
