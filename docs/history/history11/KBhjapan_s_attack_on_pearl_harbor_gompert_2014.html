<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">
<p>
Japan’s decision to bomb Pearl Harbor was a blunder of the highest order

<div id="outline-container-orgc0ff8aa" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgc0ff8aa"><span class="section-number-3">1.2</span> :claim Biggest trigger of American war invollvement was the decision to invade indochina (Laus, etc.)</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">
<p>
Perhaps the greatest misstep was the July 2, 1941, decision to invade southern Indochina.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgd6885b5" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgd6885b5"><span class="section-number-3">1.3</span> Economic self-sufficiency became a major goal of Japan after WWI</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-3">
<p>
A group of Japanese officers observing events in postwar Germany became obsessed with the importance of gaining economic autarky, including self-sufficiency through conquest.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgab98774" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgab98774"><span class="section-number-3">1.4</span> Japan and China conflict set the stage for western bitterness</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-4">
<p>
Japanese victories at Nanking, Xuzhou, Hankou, Guangzhou, Wuchang, and Hanyang did not fully suppress Chinese nationalist armies, and bitter fighting persisted.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org805a580" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org805a580"><span class="section-number-3">1.5</span> :claim: American support of China in Sino-Japanese conflict was because that they were "agast by the atrocities"</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-5">
<p>
Aghast by Japanese atrocities, America provided material assistance to the Republic of China.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org6d4bd75" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org6d4bd75"><span class="section-number-3">1.6</span> US at the time had a weak army, yet strengthened its navy + moved it to Hawaii</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-6">
<p>
Japanese officials interpreted the growth and shift of U.S. sea power as a threat to its
own sea control, trade, national well-being, and strategy.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org42d697c" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org42d697c"><span class="section-number-3">1.7</span> America's first response, after Sept. 1940 attacks in Northern Indochina, was to implement embargo on parts for warmaking</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-7">
<p>
That same month the United States halted its exports of scrap iron, steel, and aviation fuel to Japan on the grounds that it was needed at home. The embargo also extended to arms, ammunition, critical raw materials, aircraft parts,

<div id="outline-container-org2e46a97" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org2e46a97"><span class="section-number-3">1.8</span> By Jan 1941, denial of war materials grew to create big dent in Japanese industry</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-8">
<p>
January of 1941, the denial of war material was extended to copper, brass,
bronze, zinc, nickel, and potash, causing a major impact on Japanese industry
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgefae90b" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgefae90b"><span class="section-number-3">1.9</span> Japanese pact to get resources and military with Germany + Italy meant to deter the US,  but actually was viewed as an aggression</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-9">
<p>
While Japan hoped that this would deter the United States,13 in fact it compounded the affect of Japan’s occupation of northern Indochina and was taken in Washington as a move
to counter American opposition to Japanese expansionism.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgb84fb9e" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgb84fb9e"><span class="section-number-3">1.10</span> Japan attempted to remain neutral, even given the pact, come Germany &lt;&gt; Soviet invasion</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-10">
<p>
Despite German pressure, Japan maintained its neutrality with Russia and continued its move to the south.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org6ca4169" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org6ca4169"><span class="section-number-3">1.11</span> :claim: At the point of German &lt;&gt; Soviet invasion, the relationship between Japan and other world powers began to be shaped in favour of a US-Japan Conflict</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-11">
<p>
Japan thus began to shape its relationships with the major powers for a coming confrontation with the United States.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org4b72e5d" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org4b72e5d"><span class="section-number-3">1.12</span> :claim: that, because incorrect implementation, peace deals fail</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-12">
<p>
While their intentions were good, a thorough review of the episode by the historian R. J. C. Butow concludes that in fact they created con- fusion by misleading both sides with regard to the origins of various peace proposals.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org20f72ee" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org20f72ee"><span class="section-number-3">1.13</span> :claim: that the japanese creation of the co-prosperity sphere both ruptured Japanese-American relations and also remove its alliances</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-13">
<p>
Under this decision, Japan would not attack the Soviet Union despite pressure to do so from Germany; Japan would not abrogate the Tripartite Pact with Germany; and Japan would secure control over all of Indochina militarily.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org8152800" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org8152800"><span class="section-number-3">1.14</span> Japanese home minister warned against war with US, but Imperial Conference rejected it</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-14">
<p>
The home minister, Kiichiro Hiranuma, warned that war with the United States should be
avoided at all cost, but the Imperial Conference rejected the warnings.

<div id="outline-container-org752c4c1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org752c4c1"><span class="section-number-3">1.15</span> :claim: Japan was taken by surprise of the second round of American embargo despite their first round</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-15">
<p>
There was no serious examination in Tokyo of the possibility of imposition of a total embargo by the United States, Britain, and the Netherlands. They were taken by surprise.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org393c697" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org393c697"><span class="section-number-3">1.16</span> France gave up the ports in southern Indochina, and so despite Roosevelt's warnings, Japan invaded</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-16">
<p>
With the door to the rest of Indochina now opened by France, Roosevelt’s warnings not to walk into that open door were disregarded
