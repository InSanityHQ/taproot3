title: Prompt
**Origin narratives for the United States**

The telling of American history has become one of the focal points of conflicts over our national culture, particularly the relationship between ideas of American exceptionalism and stories of race and conquest in US history. Cowie, for example, highlights the pragmatic value of a shared national story as the basis for any progressive action. What is the value of a shared national narrative and what dangers does crafting such a narrative present? Why does the telling of US history generate such controversy?

In a 2-3 page, double spaced essay, evaluate how the authors we’ve read so far approach the telling of American history and make an argument for what you see as the key considerations in constructing a narrative of American history. Historical narratives, by their nature, are created through choices of what to include and what not, what to emphasize and what to relegate to the margins. In making your argument, include an explicit engagement with the sources we’ve worked with so far. You might, for example, engage with the controversy over the 1619 project and Hughes’s appeal for a “better anti-racism” or with Dunbar-Ortiz’s criticism of multiculturalism. You are also free to use the colonial sources and Morgan reading for material to ground your larger arguments into a suggestion for how to frame the early years of American colonialism.

summary: what are the key considerations in constructing an american
hist narrative. say these with explicit engagement with the texts.
</p>

<p>
how to frame early years of american colonialism is a better anti-racism
a framing on colonialism?
</p>

<p>
to understand what should be in the narrative, we need to understand the
purpose of the narrative? we shoudnt have a narrative? narrative should
be ever changing to solve societal problems?

<li>"To dismiss the rise of liberty and equality in American history as
a mere sham is not only to ignore hard facts, it is also to evade
the problem presented by those facts. The rise of liberty and
equality in this country was accompanied by the rise of slavery."
morgan, 5</li>
<li>"It was slavery, I suggest, more than any other single factor, that
had made the difference, slavery that enabled Virginia to nourish
representative government in a plantation society, slavery that
transformed the Virginia of Governor Berkeley to the Virginia of
Jefferson, slavery that made the Vir- ginians dare to speak a
political language that magnified the rights of free- men, and
slavery, therefore, that brought Virginians into the same common-
wealth political tradition with New Englanders." morgan, 26</li>
<li>"'a radical work of historical revisionism aiming to indoctrinate
our kids to hate America,' he called it. “The entire premise" of the
Times project, he told the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, 'is that
America is at root a systematically racist country to the core and
irredeemable.'” Cotton, washington post</li>
<li>"The metaphor of 1776 is more powerful than that of 1619 because
what makes America most itself isn't four centuries of racist
subjugation. It's 244 years of effort by Americans &#x2014; sometimes
halting, but often heroic &#x2014; to live up to our greatest ideal."”
Stephens, washinton post</li>
<li>"Because race-conscious anti-racism makes a ritual out of noticing
how the present is similar to the past, it can end up being blind to
the many ways in which the present differs from the past." Hughes
ABAR</li>
<li>"But this underplays how much progress we have already made", "The
current system, warts and all, has enabled huge progress for black
people in recent decades. Overturning the liberal principles on
which our institutions are based would not hasten progress towards
racial equality; it would threaten the very stability that is
required for incremental progress to occur." Hughes ABAR</li>

<li>"Even though the historical record of the Pilgrims and the Puritans
unam- biguously shows that the realization of a utopian community on
American soil utterly failed, their rhetoric has survived their
social experiments in remarkable ways." heike 159</li>
<li>"It is not incidental that 10 of this nation's first 12 presidents
were enslavers, and some might argue that this nation was founded
not as a democracy but as a slavocracy." jones 4</li>
<li>"Conveniently left out of our founding mythology is the fact that
one of the primary reasons some of the colonists decided to declare

Historical narratives dictate what is viewed as reality. We look to them
to describe the past reality but also to understand the present one.
However, narratives are inherently not reality. The process of
converting events into a narrative &#x2013; narrativization &#x2013; is
fundamentally distortive. Narrativized reality is no longer reality.
This process has four major steps: first, the myriad events of reality
are filtered based on a set of values. Second, these filtered events are
interpreted through the set of values. Third, these filtered events are
fitted into a narrative structure, and finally, fourth, this narrative
creates new values in the populace that consumes it. Each of these steps
moves the inputs farther from reality and closer to a narrative. Such is
the narrativization process, fundamentally only able to create
narratives which reflect a value set instead of reality in its entirety.
However, despite that they are not reality, narratives are still quite
valuable. But because narratives are inherently misleading, we must not
operate under a singular narrative.
</p>

<p>
This narrativization process is evident in the historical narrative
generated from the value that America is fundamentally good.
Dunbar-Ortiz gives an relatively egregious example of the distortion
inherent in this process. She describes the inside cover of the
prestigious book <i>Out of Many: A History of the American People</i>, where
an image of a "Navajo woman, dressed formally [was] weaving a nearly
finished rug," which held the design of "the Stars and Stripes." After
hearing Dunbar-Ortiz's objections, the authors of the book responded
"but it's a real photograph" (Dunbar-Ortiz, 14). The authors
cherry-picked this unrepresentative event of the rug creation and
twisted it to fit their agenda of American unity and collaboration.
While yes, it is a "real" photograph, it clearly no longer represents
reality due to the narrativization process. Others acknowledge the
atrocities committed in early American history, but argue that "what
makes America most itself isn't four centuries of racist subjugation.
It's 244 years of effort by Americans &#x2014; sometimes halting, but often
heroic &#x2014; to live up to our greatest ideal" (Ellison - Stephens).
Hughes argues in his article <i>A Better Anti-Racism</i> that "the current
system, warts and all, has enabled huge progress for black people in
recent decades," and that many underplay "how much progress we have
already made" (Hughes). This narrative of American history frames
slavery as the norm when America was created, and something that America
fought hard to abolish. It takes the same history, and makes America the
heroes.
</p>

<p>
On the flip-side, narratives can also be generated using the opposite
value &#x2013; that America is fundamentally bad. Dunbar-Ortiz points to the
prior origin narrative and directly contradicts it. She claims that
America was not "born of rebellion against oppression" and didn't lead
to "the broadening and deepening of democracy," but instead was "founded
on the ideology of white supremacy" and "crushed and subjugated the
original civilizations in the territories it now rules" (Dunbar-Ortiz,
20-22). Dunbar-Ortiz directly contradicts Hughes, claiming that the
"narrative of progress" itself is a fallacy (Dunbar-Ortiz, 20). Both
Hughes and Dunbar-Ortiz work with the same corpus of events, and come to
radically different and blatantly contradictory narratives. These
contradictions exist because they don't stem from impossible
contradictions in reality but from contradictions with the value set
each narrative was generated with. Each narrative is incomplete, and
invalid when used as a proxy for reality. However, this is no fault of
Dunbar-Ortiz or Hughes, it is simply the inherent nature of narratives.
Heike argues that the creation "of the utopian community" within America
"unambigously [and] utterly failed" (Heike, 159). However, to Stephens
or Hughes, it may seem quite a bit more ambiguous. Heike, like so many
others, falls into the trap of viewing their narrative as reality, thus
making their conclusions "unambiguous" and "utter."
</p>

<p>
Though narratives are inherently distortive and untrue when used as
proxies for reality, from narratives &#x2013; even contradicting ones &#x2013; we
can still find truth. These two opposite values, summed up as "my
country right or wrong" by Cowie, create narratives which are all
incomplete; from Morgan's description of dismissing the "rise of liberty
and equality" in America as a "mere sham" as an ignoral of the "hard
facts" to the narratives of those dismissing (Cowie 2 et al. Morgan 5).
As is declared in the "my country right" narrative, Americans did fight
long and hard against atrocity, and they did succeed in making progress.
Such is a truth we can learn and acknowledge. However, we can also
acknowledge the atrocities America has committed, and that these
atrocities still haunt us today and need to be dealt with. The American
narrative is just that: a narrative. There is truth in it just as there
is truth in Shakespeare, despite his plays being untrue in the sense
that they are not reality. We must recognize that these narratives,
while appealing to subscribe to, are not reality. Then, we must go one
step further and recognize that despite them not being reality, they
still hold truth.
