<p>
Often referred to as the era of Gilded Age &amp; Progressive Reforms, the
late 19th-early 20th century set the foundations - for better or worse -
for Modern America. Now that you have done your background reading
(YAWP) and we have three groups' research presented the time to come to
form your own conclusions about this period and argue them in your first
essay for spring.
</p>

<p>
Reminders of information covered in class:
</p>

<p>
Option 1: Thematic Essay. Take one of the three course themes and evolve
it into your argument. You may not blend more than one; your thematic
connection should be clearly evident in your thesis.
</p>

<p>
<a href="KBxHist11Sem2Day1#the big themes.html">KBxHist11Sem2Day1#the big
themes</a>
</p>

<p>
Option 2: Historians' Synthesis. Use and cite the Historians' views that
you choose to synthesize into your own, which is clearly evident in your
thesis. See Synthesis Essay in Files.
</p>

<p>
Thur/Fri: Bring your ideation and preliminary evidence to class; be
prepared to discuss with partners/small groups in order to both receive
and provide insights, suggested evidence. By end of period, submit an
outline that represents your progress to date.
</p>

<p>
For Mon/Tue Peer Review: Flesh out your outline into a rough draft,
submit to canvas and bring a paper copy to the BEGINNING of class to
exchange. First half of class is peer review and conversations, second
half is work time on edits. ** You are well advised to consult Writing
Tips document for this class which is found in Files, Research Folder.
</p>

<p>
For Thur/Fri: Final Draft due, discussion of essays in Thematic and
Synthesis groups.

i want to talk about taylorism!

about how technology changed the workforce landscape

or, could argue that combustible and compatible change over time, and
mark out times some type of meta argument about combustible/compatible?

<p>
capitalism and democracy co-evolve, and they do so along some trend?
find the trend, and argue that.
</p>

<p>
some sin-wave-esqu nav between compatible and combustible? sort of
staying within this balance? but amplitude is changing? stable
equilaberium / self-correcting system
</p>

<p>
could also talk about the barrier / connection between capitalism and
democracy, being media?
</p>

<p>
define what it actually means for something to be "compatible."
combustible != just impacting has to destroy the tenets of democracy?

<b>META</b> as the system becomes larger, shifting becomes harder so our

<li>capitalism will funnel money into the hands of the few,

rule (robber barons), thus moving toward autocracy</li>
</ul></li>

<li>AS: this quadrant also has incompatible values structures.

<li id="Almost every industrial city endured a phase of madcap expansion">klein &amp; kantor 2</li>
<li>Such a shift would not only make workers as interchangeable as the
parts they were using, it would also dramatically speed up the process
of production. If managed by trained experts, specific tasks could be
done quicker and more efficiently. Taylorism increased the scale and
scope of manufacturing and allowed for the flowering of mass
production. :: yawp</li>
<li>Industrialization and mass production pushed the United States into
the forefront of the world. The American economy had lagged behind
Britain, Germany, and France as recently as the 1860s, but by 1900 the
United States was the world's leading manufacturing nation. :: yawp</li>
<li>Industrial capitalism realized the greatest advances in efficiency and
productivity that the world had ever seen. :: yawp</li>
<li>The great financial and industrial titans, the so-called robber
barons, including railroad operators such as Cornelius Vanderbilt,
oilmen such as J. D. Rockefeller, steel magnates such as Andrew
Carnegie, and bankers such as J. P. Morgan, won fortunes that,
adjusted for inflation, are still among the largest the nation has
ever seen. According to various measurements, in 1890 the wealthiest 1
percent of Americans owned one fourth of the nation's assets; the top
10 percent owned over 70 percent. And inequality only accelerated. By
1900, the richest 10 percent controlled perhaps 90 percent of the
nation's wealth.9 :: yawp</li>

wealth, and new urban markets feeding an expanding industrial plant,
the Gilded Age was also wracked with persisting crises. ::

<li>The Great Railroad Strike of 1877&#x2026; Workers struck from Baltimore to
St. Louis, shutting down railroad traffic&#x2014;the nation's economic
lifeblood&#x2014;across the country. :: yawp</li>
<li>A general strike erupted in St. Louis, and strikers seized rail depots
and declared for the eight-hour day and the abolition of child labor.

<li>tens of thousands gathered to protest under the aegis of the
Workingmen's Party :: yawp</li>
<li>compelled armies of labor to organize and battle against the power of
capital. :: yawp</li>
<li>In the summer of 1886, the campaign for an eight-hour day, long a
rallying cry that united American laborers, culminated in a national
strike on May 1, 1886. Somewhere between three hundred thousand and
five hundred thousand workers struck across the country. :: yawp</li>
<li>"Wall Street owns the country," the Populist leader Mary Elizabeth
Lease told dispossessed farmers around 1890. "It is no longer a
government of the people, by the people, and for the people, but a
government of Wall Street, by Wall Street, and for Wall Street." ::
yawp</li>
<li>In the Populists' first national election campaign in 1892, Weaver
received over one million votes (and twenty-two electoral votes), a
truly startling performance that signaled a bright future for the
Populists. :: yawp</li>
<li>Socialists argued that wealth and power were consolidated in the hands
of too few individuals, that monopolies and trusts controlled too much
of the economy, and that owners and investors grew rich while the
workers who produced their wealth, despite massive productivity gains
and rising national wealth, still suffered from low pay, long hours,
and unsafe working conditions. :: yawp</li>
<li>According to Eugene Debs, socialists sought "the overthrow of the
capitalist system and the emancipation of the working class from wage
slavery." :: yawp</li>
<li>According to socialist organizer and newspaper editor Oscar Ameringer,
socialists wanted "ownership of the trust by the government, and the
ownership of the government by the people." :: yawp</li>
<li>Widespread dissatisfaction with new trends in American society spurred
the Progressive Era, named for the various progressive movements that
attracted various constituencies around various reforms. :: yawp 17</li>
<li>Events such as the Triangle Shirtwaist fire convinced many Americans
of the need for reform, but the energies of activists were needed to
spread a new commitment to political activism and government
interference in the economy. :: yawp 17</li>
<li>Industrial capitalism unleashed powerful forces in American life.
Along with wealth, technological innovation, and rising standards of
living, a host of social problems unsettled many who turned to reform
politics to set the world right again. :: yawp 17</li>

<b>INTRO</b> The Gilded age, spanning from the late 1860s to the early 1900s,
was fraught with tensions between capitalism and democracy. Democracy
and capitalism's compatibility &#x2013; or lack thereof &#x2013; is not a simple
binary. Instead, capitalism and democracy are made compatible through
the process of combustion. through the process of combustion, capitalism
and democracy are made compatible.
</p>

<p>
Instead of a simple binary, the relationship between capitalism and
democracy is more aptly illustrated as a set of unstable equilibriums as
shown in the following figure:
</p>

<p>
{FIGURE}
</p>

<p>
These equilibriums reside on two axes: democracy versus autocracy, and
capitalism versus socialism. Each of these axes are also continuums
between two values structures: efficiency and fairness. For example, in
the capitalism-socialism axis, capitalism fundamentally values
efficiency whereas socialism fundamentally values fairness. Thus, in the
four quadrants formed by these two axes, two of them have incompatible
values structures. These quadrants are not sustainable, so societies
within them either veer off into neighboring quadrants or fizzle out.
This behavior is inherent to each axis &#x2013; as capitalism increases, the
society will inherently move toward autocracy as wealth and power become
consolidated into the hands of the few, colloquially referred to as
"robber barons" (CITE). As democracy increases, the society will move
toward socialism as the wealthy elite are by definition a minority of
the population. Hence why democratic capitalism forms an unstable
equilibrium, moving any societies which reside in it into neighboring
quadrants. The other quadrant with incompatible value structures is
autocratic socialism, which has been shown to not function numerous
times throughout history, despite the argument that its true form has
never been tried. Thus, societies are funneled into the two quadrants
with compatible value structures: democratic socialism and autocratic
capitalism, valuing fairness and efficiency respectively. As opposed to
how incompatible quadrants push societies away, these quadrants with
shared values structures pull societies into them. These societies sink
further into these quadrants until a balancing force pushes them back
toward the middle. This balancing force is combustion.

INTRO: Scholars and historians alike have questioned for years whether
democracy and capitalism were combustible or compatible. However, the
relationship between capitalism and democracy is not a simple binary &#x2013;
the opposite of capitalism isn't democracy but rather socialism, just as
the opposite of democracy is autocracy. Instead, capitalism and
democracy are made compatible through a continual process of social
disruption &#x2013; often viewed as "combustion." When capitalism and
democracy, forces that prioritize different values and push society in
opposite directions, are too far out of balance, these disruptions can
be violent. Within America's Gilded Age, society struggled to find a
balance between these opposing forces and the values they embody.
Examples include XXX. When they are more in balance the disruptions are
milder, such as the healthy contention around elections. :: Democracy
and capitalism are made compatible through combustion ::
</p>

<p>
Instead of a simple binary, the contention between different economic
and political systems &#x2013; and the values they embrace &#x2013; can be
represented with the diagram below.
</p>

<p>
Tensions lie along two axes, with democracy versus autocracy and
capitalism versus socialism representing the extremes. Each of these
axes also represents a continuum between the opposing values of
efficiency and fairness. For example, in the capitalism-socialism axis,
capitalism fundamentally values efficiency whereas socialism
fundamentally values fairness.
</p>

<p>
Thus, in the four quadrants formed by these two axes, two of them have
incompatible values structures. These quadrants are not sustainable, so
societies within them either veer off into neighboring quadrants or
fizzle out. This behavior is inherent to each axis &#x2013; as capitalism
increases, the society will inherently move toward autocracy as wealth
and power become consolidated into the hands of the few, colloquially
referred to as "robber barons" (CITE). As democracy increases, the
society will move toward socialism as the wealthy elite are by
definition a minority of the population. Democratic capitalism lies at
an unstable equilibrium, moving any societies which reside in it into
neighboring quadrants. The other quadrant with incompatible value
structures is autocratic socialism, which has been shown to not function
numerous times throughout history across a variety of failed communist
societies. Thus, societies are funneled into the two quadrants with
compatible value structures: democratic socialism and autocratic
capitalism, valuing fairness and efficiency respectively. As opposed to
how incompatible quadrants push societies away, these quadrants with
shared values structures pull societies into them. These societies sink
further into these quadrants until a balancing force pushes them back
toward the middle. This balancing force is combustion.
</p>

<p>
The Industrial Revolution is an example of this balancing through
combustion, moving society toward autocratic capitalism with efficiency
as the driving value. Taking place between the mid seventeen and
eighteen-hundreds, America "endured a phase of madcap expansion" during
the Industrial Revolution (Klein &amp; Kantor, 2). These massive changes &#x2013;
combustion &#x2013; swept the nation, overhauling both infrastructure and
ideals. Instead of fairness, society was now chiefly concerned with a
"quest for greater productivity, for more efficient machines, [and] more
output per unit of cost" (Trachtenberg &amp; Fink, 9). And this quest was
successful, as by 1900, "the United States was the world's leading
manufacturing nation" (YAWP). However, as America slid toward efficiency
along the axis of capitalism, America was met with the accompanying
slide toward autocracy. Taylorism created an insurmountable divide
between the "workers as interchangeable as the parts they were using"
and those who owned the means of production (YAWP). Thus, the rich got
richer, and the poor stayed poor with virtually no hope of escape. This
inequality became so extreme that by 1900, "the richest 10 percent
controlled perhaps 90 percent of the nation's wealth" (YAWP). These
elite had much more power over society than the average laborer, and
were only becoming more powerful. Yes, society was efficient, but it
wasn't fair &#x2013; America had truly slid into the autocratic-capitalism
upper quadrant, and it was time for another combustion.
</p>

<p>
Society combusted once again to form a balancing response to the
Industrial Revolution and its consequences. Inequality had become too
extreme, and working conditions had become too poor. Society began to
shift towards valuing fairness once again: "Wall Street owns the
country," declared the popular People's Party participant Mary Elizabeth
Lease in 1890. "It is no longer a government of the people&#x2026; but a
government of Wall Street" (YAWP). Sold on the need for reform, workers
banded together, trying to utilize their strength in numbers to create
change. They formed unions such as the Knights of Labor and the AFL,
going on strikes in the hundreds of thousands. Events like the Triangle
Shirtwaist Factory fire convinced American society at large "of the need
for reform" (YAWP). Socialism was gaining prominence, democracy was
being restored, and society was combusting; the Progressive Era had been
born.

I spent a long time thinking about this essay, as I felt like their was
some type of meta-narrative. I had this vague sense of some type of
self-balancing system, as well as some false dichotomies, but I coudn't
figure out how they fit together. I ended up sitting down with a pencil
and paper and just thinking about it, and I think I was able to figure
it out. Next time, I think I will try to front-load more thinking so I
can be more efficient.
</p>

<p>
My notes worked pretty well, I felt like I had easy access to all the
readings I had. Next time, I want to generate more clear summaries of
what type of thing I can look for in each reading in some separate
document.
</p>

<p>
I would also like to have some more peer editing next time around.
</p>

<p>
For the reading and presenting process, I think next time I'll focus on
some more organization prior. I think scaffolding the conversation a bit
more will allow for better direction towards the audience.
</p>

<p>
I think this essay, all things considered, went pretty smoothly. Looking
forward to the Research Project!
