uncertainty is different from scientific uncertainty - A lot of people
may be uninformed for this reason - Sometimes it is hard to make a
distinction between uncertainty in future events based upon current
scientific understanding and understanding in the current situation - A
lot of scientists see their jobs as knowledge finders/creators and not
communicators of this knowledge - Some even sneer at those who are
trying to communicate the consensus calling them populerizers(I give up
on spelling).</span></p><p><span>### What now - While no scientific conclusion is provable, our current
understanding is our best and relatively strong - It is therefore the
most logical to take action on - However, there is no one measurement of
scientific reliability</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="c-plus-plus-that-reflects-my-current-feelings-on-this"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>C Plus Plus that Reflects my Current Feelings on this</span></span></h2><section><pre class="language-cpp"><code class="language-cpp">  #include <iostream>
