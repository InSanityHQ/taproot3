sciences (or reversed, it's unclear)</span></p><p><span>Argues that feminist critiques of "the social sciences are dismissed out
of hand by philosophers of science on the ground that the social
sciences arn't science anyways," then says: "it is, however, not quite
so easy to dismiss biology as pseudo science." Despite the fact that she</span><em><span>just drew a distinction between biology and social sciences.</span></em></p><p><span>Calls case study of outdated model of fertilization process -- says that

know in 1895. The new model barely changed the previous model. What does
"largely ignored" even mean? To my knowledge, this isn't a very hotly
debated or discussed topic. Is that what she means by ignoring it?</span></p><p><span>She goes on to say that the new theory is still controversial, and they
don't know if it's entirely correct!</span></p><p><span>Of course people stuck with teaching the old model then! And the
electron microscope was invented in 1931! She claims this was discovered
using electron microscopy in 1895!</span></p></section><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-6"><h6 class="firn-headline firn-headline-6" id="wtaf-is-this-reading?"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>wtaf is this reading?</span></span></h6><section><p><span>Gives examples of clearly incorrect biological explanations of why men
are more intelligent that women form specific scientists, and uses them
to generalize all of male biologists. </span><em><span>Nice.</span></em></p><p><span>Drawings that updated skeletons to be gender specific were "favored for
just that (the fact that they reflected cultural ideals of masculinity)
over drawings that were in some sense more accurate."</span></p><p><span>What exactly does "in some sense more accurate" mean?</span></p><blockquote><p><span>  A science based upon women would be an improvement over the current
  science, according to standpoint epistemology.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>Essentially argues that between two choices, scientific theory cannot
guarantee that one is true. Yeah, that's the point.</span></p><p><span>Argues that since theories are based upon one another, and since
original theories were created in deeply sexist times, the sexist
theories persevere regardless of the current state of cultural sexism.</span></p><p><span>This is reasonable, but we scientists do backtrack significantly when
new evidence is presented. It's not as if these sexists theories have
tainted modern theories forever.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="reflection"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Reflection</span></span></h2><section><p><span>Well, that was certainly interesting.</span></p></section><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="discussion-point:"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Discussion Point:</span></span></h3><section><p><span>I wonder what the author means by "in some sense more accurate" when
