Wang makes three main arguments in his paper </span><em><span>No, Economics Is
Not a Science</span></em><span>. He argues that the building blocks of real sciences
don't change, and that the building blocks of economics do. Thus, it is
not a science. However, the reality that we apply our science to
changes, the tools we use to measure the world changes, and for
economics, the overarching models of the world that are developed don't
change. At this point, is that not effectively the same thing as the
building blocks themselves changing? His second point is that humans
have free will, and thus, cannot be absolutely predicted or explained.
Therefore, it is not a science. The thing is, nothing can be absolutely
explained or predicted. This reductionist view of the world has been
disproved countless times over with Godel's Theory of Incompleteness,
the three body problem, and much more. It doesn't matter what science
you study, you will never be able to fully predict or explain what it
deals with. His third and final point is that one cannot easily test
hypothesis that arise from the field of economics. Is Astronomy a
science? We can confidently predict where planets will be in multiple
thousands of years without traveling thousands of years in the future.
Additionally, as the capabilities of technology increase, we can begin
to simulate these scenarios to test hypotheses, as with the study of
global warming---unless of course, that isn't science either.</span></p><p><span>I am not arguing that economics is a science. I am not arguing that
