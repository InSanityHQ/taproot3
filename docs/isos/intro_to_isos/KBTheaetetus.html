unsatisfying. We end with no definition of knowledge, a dead Socrates,
and an </span><em><span>opportunity</span></em><span> for a definition of knowledge. I would like to
explore this opportunity with a slight modification to Theaetetus's
second definition (D2).</span></p><p><span>I am operating in the premise that we fundamentally cannot know how
"close to truth"(for lack of a better term) our perception is. This
renders any definitions of knowledge involving truth useless.</span></p><p><span>D2 essentially states that knowledge is perception. This gets "debunked"
by Socrates in multiple ways. Socrates points out that people can have
differing perceptions of the same event, and therefore perception cannot
equate to truth, and by extension, knowledge.</span></p><p><span>I would respond that knowledge does not have to be "truthful" in order
to be knowledge, otherwise the very concept of knowledge would be
flawed.</span></p><p><span>Socrates also equates perception to sight, and by operating inside the
premise of D2, perception to knowledge.</span></p><blockquote><p><span>  But to say 'He doesn't see' is to say 'He doesn't know', if 'sees' is
  'knows'</span></p></blockquote><p><span>He then brings up memory, and this is where my slight alteration comes
into play. A person does not forget knowledge when they don't see it, as
knowledge is not perception but rather a </span><em><span>record</span></em><span> of perception. This
record, and perception for that matter, does not need to be biological.</span></p><p><span>This is my proposed definition of knowledge. I am mostly sure it is
incorrect, and I am eager to find out why. Sorry if this was a little
long, I was just very unsatisfied with the conclusion of this reading.</span></p></section></div></div></div></article><div class="metapanel"><div class="metalabel">Contents</div><ol><li><a href="#\(theatetus\)">\(THEATETUS\)</a><ol><li><a href="#socrates--plato-on-knowledge">Socrates / Plato on Knowledge</a><ol><li><a href="#personal-thoughts:-what-is-knowledge?">Personal Thoughts: What is Knowledge?</a></li></ol></li></ol></li><li><a href="#record-of-perception-is-knowledge">Record of perception is knowledge.</a></li><li><a href="#\[discussion\-point,\-begin\]">\[Discussion\ point,\ begin.\]</a></li></ol><div class="metalabel">Backlinks</div><ul class="firn-backlinks"><li class="firn-backlink"><a href="/isos/intro_to_isos/KBISOSMasterIndex">ISOS Master Index</a></li></ul></div></main></body></html>
