What techniques did you use for
  getting the most out of readings and for formulating useful discussion
  points?</span></p><ul><li><p><span>I approached the readings without assuming that what I was reading
    was 'thruthful.' This led me to analyse the texts more deeply, and
    forced me to only accept ideas that I had thought through. For
    discussion points, I tried to approach them with curiosity and ask
    one of many genuine questions that I was left with after doing the
    reading.</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><span>Our class is dependent on students engaging in discussions. What kind
  of role do you play in discussion, and what helps you be better at
  that role? What goals do you have for yourself in next semester's
  discussions?</span></p><ul><li><p><span>I would like to think I provide unique viewpoints to the discussion.
    Sometimes, unique viewpoints which reveal assumptions don't allow
    the class to progress through the material at the desired pace. Next
    semester, I hope to find a balance.</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><span>What kind of role did you play in your group project, the Bad Science
  presentation? What goals do you have for yourself in future group
  projects?</span></p><ul><li><p><span>I played the role of a person working equally with their friends. We
    all contributed, we all had fun, and we all learned. I would like to
    continue this in the future.</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><span>How might you apply what you learned in ISOS this fall to being a
  scientist in your science classes or to using scientific information
  to make informed choices as a citizen?</span></p><ul><li><p><span>I am now a Postmodernist. There is no subjective truth. Nothing is
    real. Seriously speaking, I think that not recognizing ones own
    assumptions or taking some truth for granted is incredibly
    dangerous, and ISOS is a class that helps us avoid this danger. More
    specifically, perhaps the most interesting idea we have discussed is
    the idea of robustness, and how we can view ideas as a sort of
    interconnected web; as this web moves away from being linear and
    becomes increasingly interconnected, one idea in the web being
    proved 'false' is much less destructive and can be remedied much
    more quickly. This is a way I will try to design my own systems in
    the future.</span></p></li></ul></li></ul></section></div></div></article><div class="metapanel"><div class="metalabel">Contents</div><div class="metalabel">Backlinks</div><ul class="firn-backlinks"><li class="firn-backlink"><a href="/isos/intro_to_isos/KBISOSMasterIndex">ISOS Master Index</a></li></ul></div></main></body></html>
