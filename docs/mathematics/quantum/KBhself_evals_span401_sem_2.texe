\tableofcontents

\begin{enumerate}
\item Spanish Language Proficiency
\end{enumerate}

I tried to improve my ability in speaking and listening in the language, which is the objectives that I am most interested in improving in. Because of the fact that communication is one of the most important marks of mastering a language, I am happy to focus on and improve my ability in this area.

I think this is the first semester where I can confidently say that I am able to grasp the gist of a full conversation and carry it forward by focusing on the content without much worry for the language itself. 

\begin{enumerate}
\item Personal Growth
\end{enumerate}

In this class, I was able to complete much of my work in a way that embraces the spontaneity of conversations. I think I have finally, through this class, gained enough proficiency in the content to be able to work.

I think I am very happy with the fact that I was able to grapple with Esperanza. Although its not a very hard text, the fact that I was able grasp the main idea of chaper-by-chapter with reasonable ease. I hope to continue work on this in the coming days. 

\begin{enumerate}
\item Habits of Learning
\end{enumerate}

I think I have consistently pushed myself 
through the Spanish program to try to do the best and participate fullest in class. During the class, I am trying to be very active in participation---as it allows me to practice my original goals in improving speaking and listening more fully.
