estimate because there was no correct answer. Instead, error was taken
as the precision at which the number was considered "close enough" by
the human doing the curve fit. Depending on the size of the value (and
scale of the Desmos slider), this results in an absolute error ranging
from 0.1 units to 0.001 units.</span></p><p><span>These uncertainties were propagated through calculations as follows: \[

difference between standard resistances and those measured by a

within uncertainties of the model predicted \(\tau\) value for all
circuits except the fit in Figure 1. This is likely due to the high
uncertainties placed on smaller scale curve fits, especially the final
trial. Furthermore, with the unexpectedly large 20% uncertainties in
capacitance all trials fell within the uncertainties of the experiment.
Thus, the model predicted the charging behavior of capacitors over time
accurately. For future iterations, numerical errors could have been
better predicted if the specifications of the exact parts used to build
the circuit were available. Additionally, more systematic curve fit
heuristics could have been used such as RSME. The exact numerical
analysis for this section can be found</span><strong><a class="firn-external" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Hw9ooz0CtAvTP9vtw1VT9pVyfsW39IojwwrQX94VJQY/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a></strong><span>.</span></p></section></div></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="integration-of-current"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Integration of Current</span></span></h1><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="procedure"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Procedure</span></span></h2><section><p><span>Another way to evaluate the model is to compare the amount of

\]</span></p><p><span>This is similar to the model used in the previous procedure, but voltage
variables are replaced with charge. Current flow through the circuit is
used as a proxy to calculate the amount of charge accumulated in the
capacitor. As before, current is measured across a resistor using a
digital probe and Logger Pro.</span></p><p><span>The amount of charge on the capacitor was calculated by taking a Riemann
sum of the momentary current measurements. In addition, the voltage
measurements across the capacitor were used as another proxy to
calculate the amount of charge on the capacitor.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="results"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Results</span></span></h2><section><p><span>The values of the three theoretically identical methods of calculating

was 0.00319C, or the equivalent of 3.19V on the capacitor.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="analysis"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Analysis</span></span></h2><section><p><span>As the graph shows, both proxies of charge on the capacitor generally
agree with the model but come up with smaller values of charge. Notably,
the two experimental proxies don't agree with each other either,
suggesting some systematic error is at play.</span></p><p><span>One culprit may be misaligned data: if the Riemann sum calculation began
after charging, then the entire sum would be skewed low. However, the
sum plot is not a vertical translation of the theoretical value, which
suggests the effect of this issue is minimal or canceled. Another issue
may be miscalibrated sensors: if each amperage measurement was off by
\(10^{-5}\)A, the cumulative affect would drag down the total as time
went on. The effect of this drift can be counteracted by taking the
average of readings when no charge should be flowing, multiplying by the
number of data points, and subtracting the total from the final charge
value. However, the calculated drift was an order of magnitude greater
than the total accumulated charge, so the author did not numerically
sanitize against this drift.</span></p><p><span>Although the intermediate charge values do not match the model, the
final accumulated charge is sensical: 3.19 volts is close to the
expected 3.2 volts. The same errors mentioned previously contribute to
this difference, but the accuracy of the result suggests that the effect
was canceled.</span></p><p><span>The Farad Definition line (red) in Figure 6 has blips for unkown
reasons. When the battery was off, the probe measured voltages on the
order of \(10^{-9}\) for a few ticks before measuring a faulty value, so
a similar stepping phenomenon may be occuring in the voltage
meauserement.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="conclusion"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Conclusion</span></span></h2><section><p><span>The Riemann sums of measured current align with the model and expected
charge calculated by the voltage on the capacitor and the definition of
the Farad. Thus, the model accurately predicts experimental behavior,
suggesting that it is correct. Although the graphs differed slightly,
these may be attributed to the subjective curve fit metric, sensor
inaccuracies while measuring small flows of current, or sensor
calibration inaccuracies. Future analysis could be more accurate by
calculating the false zero point of the sensor, using various tick times
to find the most effective range for that sensor, and having more
accurate values for uncertainty for circuit components and the digital
probe.</span></p><p><span>Source analysis</span><a class="firn-external" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eDmGRePGh8PVv2aKhVhv-TNJc3_n8H7HUrAMvxOG1Vs/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">*here*</a><span>.</span></p></section></div></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="time-constant-with-various-components"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Time Constant with Various Components</span></span></h1><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="equipment"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Equipment</span></span></h2><section><ul><li><p><span>Breadboard</span></p></li><li><p><span>Capacitors (100\(\mu\)F-1000\(\mu\)F)</span></p></li><li><p><span>Resistors (99.8k\(\Omega\)-1M\(\Omega\))</span></p></li><li><p><span>3 volt battery pack</span></p></li><li><p><span>Multimeter</span></p></li><li><p><span>Stopwatch</span></p></li></ul></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="procedure"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Procedure</span></span></h2><section><p><span>Most of the analysis for data collected as a class was done on the
