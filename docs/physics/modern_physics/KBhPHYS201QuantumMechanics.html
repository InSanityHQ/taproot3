voltage need to be added to stop the protons. If the stopping voltage is
small, it will need to fight the voltage but completes the circut. As

electrons don't have enough energy to complete the circut.</span></p><p><span>Increase Vstop untill current drops to 0.</span></p><p><span>\(V_{stop} \times Q_e = KE\). The kinetic energy of ejected electrons is
