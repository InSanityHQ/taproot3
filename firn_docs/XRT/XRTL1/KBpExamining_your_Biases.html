I have plenty of ideas, but for the most part I do not say them because I lack the confidence, I don't think they will be helpful, I am scared of getting shot down (fear of failure), or I think about how other people think about me too much (self conscious). This is something that I am working with in all facets in life, whether that be DATAS, or even socializing.
