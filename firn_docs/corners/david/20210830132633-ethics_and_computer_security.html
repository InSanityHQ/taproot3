I think reporting the bug to Gawker rather than privately contacting AT&T was somewhat unethical as it didn't provide the company a chance to properly respond, although I can understand why he might've preferred it (AT&T could sweep it under the rug, but not if it's public). I also think actually collecting all of the emails once he was aware of the vulnerability was unethical and didn't contribute to any possible investigation of the vulnerability.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="what,-if-any,-actions-in-this-story-do-you-think-should-be-illegal?-what-actions-are-actually-illegal?-specify-laws-that-might-be-relevant,-even-if-no-one-was-caught-or-prosecuted"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>What, if any, actions in this story do you think should be illegal?
