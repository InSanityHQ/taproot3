Why?</span></p></li></ol><p><span>No info available, although it seems as if he is most interested in allowing absolute democracy: he opposed a one-person executive branch because he thought it’d lead to monarchy, and he focused on his pitch for a bicameral legislative branch representing the people for the Convention.</span></p><ol><li><p><span>What form would you like to see the legislative branch have? Why?</span></p></li></ol><p><span>It should be a bicameral system where one chamber is determined by the population (for 3-year terms) and the other by state (with 7-year terms), satisfying both sides of the controversy. Both would have seats divided by population.</span></p><ol><li><p><span>How should representation in the legislature be determined?

He also thought that the federal government should have the right to use force to convince states to comply with federal laws, but was pressured out of including it in the Virginia Plan.</span></p><ol><li><p><span>Cite your sources!</span></p></li></ol><p><span>https://www.ushistory.org/germantown/people/randolph.htm
