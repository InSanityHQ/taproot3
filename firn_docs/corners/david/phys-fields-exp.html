We calculate electric potential with the equation $V = \int E \cdot dr$. Because of the dot product, any movement perpendicular to the E-field does not change the potential. So, the points with the same electric potential all form a line perpendicular to the E-field.
The electric potential of the E-field is equal at every point on a sphere around a point charge with the charge at the center of the sphere.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="questions"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Questions</span></span></h1><section><p><span>How does all of this work in the context of </span><a href="#id:c3e0ec96-1b01-4fac-87fd-9410dc3af722">Conductors/Insulators</a><span>?</span></p></section></div></div></div></article><div class="metapanel"><div class="metalabel">Contents</div><ol><li><a href="#topics-covered">Topics Covered</a></li><li><a href="#1-place-a-single-charge-in-the-working-area-using-the-e-field-sensor-(with-&quot;values&quot;-selected),-and-the-measuring-tape,-confirm-that-the-e-field-calculated-by-the-phet-simulation-agrees-with-the-equation-we-have-used-in-class-(note,-the-units-for-e-field-that-we-learned-in-class-were-nc-the-phet-simulation-may-express-the-units-differently-but-the-numerical-values-should-be-the-same)">1.
