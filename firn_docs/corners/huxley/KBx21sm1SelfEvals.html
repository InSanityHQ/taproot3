helped you to see math problems in new parts of the world where you
might not have previously noticed them.  On a scale of 1 (not
successful) to 5 (very successful), how successful has this class been
in achieving this goal?  - 4</span></p><p><span>1B.  What would have to change to move this number closer to 5? -
Perhaps a brainstorm at the beginning of the year for finding math
problems in unusual places, and another at the end of the year. - Can be
short - I personally have a lot of fun brainstorming about cool problems
that I don't need to worry about solving</span></p><p><span>TOPIC 2:  Giving you confidence to attack problems without explicit
instructions 2A.  I hope that this class has helped you to try solving
applied math problems that you might have previously assumed were beyond
you..  On a scale of 1 (not successful) to 5 (very successful), how
successful has this class been in achieving this goal?  - 5</span></p><p><span>2B.  What would have to change to move this number closer to 5? - N/A</span></p><p><span>TOPIC 3:  COMAP Contest 3A.  What were the pros of participating in this
contest? - Learned ALOT. For our team, our lives were consumed by COMAP
for around two weeks straight. - As well as learning a lot about problem
solving and math itself, I learned a lot about tackling gargantuan tasks
over longer time spans and optimal teamwork strategies</span></p><p><span>3B.  What were the cons of participating in this contest? - While the
grind was super fun, it was also decently stressful on both my teams
bodies and minds. - Due to some last minute events, the end of the
competition got very very crunched.</span></p><p><span>3C.  Given the choice to do that part of the semester over, with an
option to work on a teacher-guided problem instead, would you choose to
participate in the contest, or to work on the teacher-guided problem? -
I would most likely choose to participate in the contest. While it led
to a difficult few weeks, it also led to an immensely valuable few
weeks.</span></p><p><span>TOPIC 4:  How the class went 4A.  If you could do this class over again,
what would you do differently?  What would you keep the same? - I would
focus more on frontloading math and then expanding as opposed to doing
as much research prior to the problem. - For COMAP, there is a plethora
of minor things I would do differently to try and achieve greater
success in the competition. - I would keep trying to work with people
who I can learn a lot from</span></p><p><span>4B.  If you were teaching this class, what would you do differently? 
What would you keep the same? - This class was absolutely wonderful and
perhaps one of the most fun classes I have taken. If I were to teach it,
I would avoid grouping the same people together repeatedly, and perhaps
I would add around 10 minutes of optional reflection time after each
problem in class. - The pacing of the problems felt really right.</span></p><p><span>4C.  Tell me about one topic or math problem that you now enjoy thinking
about as a result of this class. - Whenever I see a lake, I always start
to think about what the bottom of it looks like..</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="japanese"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>japanese</span></span></h2><section><ul><li><p><span>One of the highlights this semester for me was the role play
  assignment. I really enjoyed coming up with the story and writing the
  script, being able to use all the new forms we just learned. I think I
  improved most with my cohesion of speech this semester, at the end
  being able to actually formulate sentences on to spot to communicate
  what I wanted too.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Some of the more challenging tasks for me this semester were the kanji
  quizzes, as I spend a long time studying all the kanji. Next semester,
  I want to spread out my studying for the quizzes across a longer time
  so I can study more effectively.</span></p></li><li><p><span>My goal for this semester was to expand the amount of different
  sentence structures I can use to express what I want to say. I
  definitely did do this!</span></p></li><li><p><span>For next semester, I want to focus on improving the fluidity of my
  sentences.</span></p></li></ul></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="som"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>som</span></span></h2><section><p><span>Write 3-5 sentences each answering the following questions: - Describe
one surprising connection that you were able to make between your
research and personal practices this semester? - Connecting to our
learning about sleep, I noticed that I felt better even with the same
amount of sleep when the sleep took place over a more consistent
segment. I track my sleep with my watch, and often over the weekends
when I get more sleep but shifted later in the day, I would still be
quite tired and not function as well. Over the break, I am going to try
to work on shifting my sleep to become more consistent regardless of the
time of week.</span></p><ul><li><p><span>Describe the emotion practice that was most meaningful, helpful or
  useful for you. What did you learn about yourself by using this
  practice?</span></p></li><li><p><span>My dad meditates every day after he wakes up and before he goes to
  bed, never missing a day. During the emotion practices, I decided to
  join him in this practice, however only before bed. I noticed that
  over the two weeks I did this, my sleep improved (as measured by the
  amount of times I woke up during the night) and my average heart rate
  dropped by ~20bpm! I struggled to meditate every night, but I'm going
  to try to figure out a way to do it consistently over the break.</span></p></li><li><p><span>How do you plan on incorporating what you learned this semester into
  your life moving forward?</span></p></li><li><p><span>I want to focus on sleeping more consistently, and meditating. Over
  the weekend I'm often up late as I don't have the deadline of an early
  wakeup the next day, so I just keep working until late in the night. I
  think I'm going to try setting a hard deadline at night, where after
  that time, I don't start any new work. I've also started doing a lot
  more data tracking about myself, including sleep, heart rate, and also
  rigorous time tracking. This data has helped me see what is helpful,
  and when I can use it.</span></p></li></ul></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="english"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>english</span></span></h2><section><ol><li><p><span>In considering recent assignments, what are you proud of? (aspects of
   your writing process, your argumentation, growth in meeting a
   particular learning outcome, working with a partner, orally
   communicating your ideas, etc.) Knowing what I need to specify and
   how to specify effectively is a skill I've been working on throughout
   this semester. Especially in my recent assignments, I've gotten quite
   a lot better at this specification. This growth in both ability to
   specify and also knowing where to specify is something I am quite
   proud of.</span></p></li><li><p><span>What are your areas of strength in terms of /literary analysis/ as we
   close the semester? Coming into this class, my areas of strength in
   terms of literary analysis were being able to grasp and create big
   picture connections. Throughout the semester, I have gained the
   strength of being able to clearly support these ideas from precise
   analysis of specific elements in the text. I have improved the most
   on clearly communicating the connections between different levels of
   abstraction, most commonly from the level of abstraction used when
   close reading to the level of abstraction of topic sentences.</span></p></li><li><p><span>What are your continued goals as a writer/reader/speaker for next
   semester? I want to work on improving my communication.
   Fundamentally, communication is what writing, reading, and speaking
   is all about. More specifically, I want to focus on tailoring my
   communication to fit my audience, as meaning not understood is worth
   as much as no meaning at all.</span></p></li></ol></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="compsec"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>compsec</span></span></h2><section><p><span>Please write 1-2 sentences per question, or as much as you need to
answer the question. Do not write your answers in the school website! If
you reload the page by accident, your work is gone. Write them in Docs
or Word or your favorite text editor and then copy them in.</span></p><p><span>Share an example of something that made you proud (for instance, a
difficult problem you solved in one of your projects or an improvement
you made to your work). - Though it wasn't my most successful
assignment, I was quite proud of my Forensics submission. It was really
nice to be able to clearly see the fruits of my perseverance once I
finally solved the problem. I went in completely new to the field, and
managed to come out with an answer! I also thought my NN hash was pretty
interesting.</span></p><p><span>Of the concepts we discussed, which one(s) did you find most interesting
or surprising, and why? - I found encryption and signing to be quite
fascinating. It was super cool to think about ways that we can make data
conditionally viewed with clever algorithms -- PGP still amazes me.</span></p><p><span>What concepts did you find most challenging, and why? - Forensics was
the hardest for me to feel like I understood how to do -- in fact, I
still don't feel like I understand how to do it. To me, forensics feels
like a lot of guessing without a logical progression of steps. It's not
just that the steps aren't clear, it's that the actual jumps between
them don't make any sense. Perhaps this is the nature of constructed
problems like these.</span></p><p><span>What are some ways that you displayed good habits of mind or contributed
to a good learning environment in the class? - One of the things I love
about classes like these is that I have the freedom to try things that I
know I could fail at, and as a result, I learn a lot more. I utilized
this freedom quite a bit, consistently trying things with no assurance
of success. I also engage in these types of projects with my friends,
like during the long block where Nick and I decided to try and build a
secure chat application from scratch in two hours.</span></p><p><span>What was the most useful or memorable piece of feedback you received
this semester, and how did you act on it? - I enjoyed thinking about and
responding to the feedback on my Legal/Ethical Reflection assignment. By
engaging with the feedback, I was able to deepen my understanding quite
a bit.</span></p></section></div></div></div></div></article><div class="metapanel"><div class="metalabel">Contents</div><ol><li><a href="#self-eval-time">Self Eval time.</a><ol><li><a href="#modern-phys">modern phys</a></li><li><a href="#mathmod">mathmod</a></li><li><a href="#japanese">japanese</a></li><li><a href="#som">som</a></li><li><a href="#english">english</a></li><li><a href="#compsec">compsec</a></li></ol></li></ol><div class="metalabel">Backlinks</div></div></main></body></html>
