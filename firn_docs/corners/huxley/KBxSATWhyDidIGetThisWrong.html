b i got this wrong because i wasnt sure about 30,60,90 triangles. i
should have checked which sides were which! make sure to check sides.

this wrong because i simplified to find a side length instead of the
perimeter. i got too caught up, and didnt think to ask myself again,
"what am i solving for? what do i have?" lesson: ALWAYS ask yourself
what you are </span><em><span>actully</span></em><span> solving for and also what you got */ c29 :: c, b
i answered the positive instead of the negative! got too tunnel vision
in the graph. lesson: always glance at the other answer choices, or
consider them before you do the question! /* c35 :: 8, 13 tinspire only
gives one set of answers for polynomial with nsolve. instead, use
