this wrong because i simplified to find a side length instead of the

i answered the positive instead of the negative! got too tunnel vision
in the graph. lesson: always glance at the other answer choices, or
consider them before you do the question! /* c35 :: 8, 13 tinspire only
gives one set of answers for polynomial with nsolve. instead, use

answers! </span><strong><span>/ ## blb9 /</span></strong><span> w7 :: a, d i got this wrong because i didn't know

supposed to answer VS what you just solved for before moving on. </span><strong><span>*</span></strong><span>
nc111: d, b i got this wrong because i got an answer which worked, and
didnt consider that others could as well. in the future, whenever you

remember, radicals are always positive!! if it's simple, just plug and
chug. </span><strong><span>*</span></strong><span> c16 :: d,b i got this wrong because i didn't regognize the

your assumptions. sometimes, words can be used differently. */ w15 :: a,
c i got this wrong because i was too focused on the idea of conscision
and grammar. writing is more than grammar! lesson: conclusions need
transitions! transitioning from previous ideas to new ideas is required.
/* w16 :: b, a i got this wrong because not sound blackbook advice. only
use the who/whom thing when they are explicitly asking you about it! and
use your ear! the reason why the right answer is better is because it
places the subject closer to its pronoun ("both")</span></p><p><span>lesson: trust the ear! think about placement of operators and subjects!
/* w29 :: c, b i got this wrong because i got too caught up in the
sandwiches for em dashes and commas. lesson: if an em dash is an answer,
consider it with the sandwiching rule </span><strong><span>and</span></strong><span> on its own! same goes for
commas. */ w35 :: c, d</span></p><p><span>i got this wrong because i ignored the parenthetical phrase. you can't
always do this! the paranthetical phrase made it so that only one answer
was correct, because it was referring to something that needed to be at
the end of the sentence.</span></p><p><span>lesson: consider what concepts need to be at the end and beginning of a
sentence, especially if it doesnt make sense! check out parentheticals
as well </span><strong><span>*</span></strong><span> w39 :: c, b</span></p><p><span>dont be so quick to elim things if you don;t know what they are testing
you on! lesson: again, be super warry about what is mentioned at the end
of the previous sentence and the beginning of the next sentence! */ w42

lesson: make sure to read the whole sentence and listen for if it sounds
right! this way, you can catch tricks! /* nc9 :: c,a was using radius
instead of diameter.</span></p><p><span>lesson: used to working with radius. watch out for diameters! </span><strong><span>*</span></strong><span> nc10

design questions. look at the answers, check what mistakes they could be
looking for. */ nc10 :: 3, 3/2 i got this wrong because i dropped a

it's validated! things always matter. /* nc20 i got this wrong because i

of \(2 \pi r = c\). always make sure to double check you are using the
right equation! also, inverses of things you are dividing by is simply
1/(whatever you are dividing by). don't confuse yourself.</span></p><p><span>lesson: pause for one second, sanity check the equation you are using.
*/ nc12 :: tip if you see a subtraction, think about making it viable.
ie. multiply the top and bottom to get it to equal the same thing, and
then it should / might fall out. /* nc13 :: tip if an equation has no
real solutions, that means that it never touches the x axis. you can put
it into vertex form and find what needs to happen for the y value to be
appropiate (higher than 0 or lower depending on if the parabola is
facing upwards or downwards). </span><strong><span>*</span></strong><span> nc19 :: geuss 2, 1.5 i got this wrong
because i didn't factor in the number i was adding into the divisor for
the average. tip: convert decimals / percentages to numbers! either on
paper or in head.</span></p><p><span>lesson: write it out on paper. percentages</span></p><hr /></section></div></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="to-review"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>To review</span></span></h1><section><ul><li><p><span>polynomial division [ x ]</span></p></li><li><p><span>remainder theorem [ x ]</span></p></li><li><p><span>using quadratic formula [ x ]</span></p></li><li><p><span>box and whisker plots [ x ]</span></p></li><li><p><span>circles equations! centers [ x ]</span></p><ul><li><p><span>completing the square [ x ]</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><span>unit conversions [ x ]</span></p></li><li><p><span>vertex form [ x ]</span></p></li><li><p><span>30-60-90 triangles [ x ]</span></p></li><li><p><span>radian and degree conversions [ x ]</span></p></li><li><p><span>pythagorean triples [ x ]</span></p></li></ul><p><span>(52-5)+(44-10)+(20-9)+(38-7)</span></p><p><span>33+37</span></p><p><span>700</span></p><p><span>710 52 -> 40 43 -> 39</span></p><p><span>790</span></p><p><span>17 + 35 = 52 52 -> 750</span></p><p><span>790+750 = 1540</span></p><p><span>51 + 37</span></p><p><span>51 -> 39 37 -> 33</span></p><p><span>720</span></p><p><span>17 + 36 -> 780</span></p><p><span>48 -> 37 43 -> 39 -> 760</span></p><p><span>18 + 37 = 55 -> -> 760</span></p></section></div></div></div></article><div class="metapanel"><div class="metalabel">Contents</div><ol><li><a href="#why-did-i-get-this-wrong?">Why did i get this wrong?</a><ol><li><a href="#tests">tests</a><ol><li><a href="#ajt-#2">ajt #2</a></li><li><a href="#bb1">bb1</a></li><li><a href="#bb3">bb3</a></li></ol></li><li><a href="#ka-math-diagnostic">ka math diagnostic</a></li><li><a href="#blb7">blb7</a></li><li><a href="#blub6">blub6</a></li></ol></li><li><a href="#to-review">To review</a></li></ol><div class="metalabel">Backlinks</div></div></main></body></html>
