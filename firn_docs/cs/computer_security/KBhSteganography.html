Such techniques allow for both a mild form of encryption --- though, it is necessarily noted that the fundamental concepts of steg, inherently, does not provide adequate encryption --- and the deniability for having sent a piece of information.</span></p><p><span>A majority of the steg systems is centered around the hiding of data inside images because of the fact that subtle sub-pixel alterations could be made to an image without influencing the general shape or design of the image.</span></p><p><span>The actual act of mixing data within images is not practically difficult. However, the process of decoding --- once received --- which of the mixed assortment of data contained the modified bits is much more difficult. It is additionally difficult to perform the act highlighted above without betraying that an image has indeed be modified.</span></p></section><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="common-stegnography-techniques"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Common Stegnography Techniques</span></span></h1><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="lowest-noisy-bit"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Lowest Noisy Bit</span></span></h2><section><p><span>In a reasonably noisy image, one it is possible to identify the lowest bits in the image (black spots) and alter them to encode information. As long as the darkest bits remain dark, one could simply switch their color completely and use, for instance, color distance from black, as the encoded information.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="chaffing-and-winnowing"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Chaffing and Winnowing</span></span></h2><section><p><span>Chaffing and Winnowing is a transmission technique that leverages traditional authentication techniques to perform stenography. With every encoded message, an arbitrary amount of miscellaneous bits are intermixed with failing check bits. Via simple async-key encryption, only the intended recipient who would be capable of verifying the check bits would be able to figure the intended bits.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="bpcs-steg"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>BPCS Steg</span></span></h2><section><p><span>Leveraging the visual property that large, complexly ragged areas is usually perceived as somewhat uniform (i.e. a beach etc.), BPCS steg identifies and swaps these complex or noisy areas in a specific way --- mostly by simplifying it into less complex geometries --- and uses the shades of those to encode information</span></p></section></div></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="threat-model-relating-to-steganography"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Threat Model Relating to Steganography</span></span></h1><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="specifically,-what-are-we-protecting?"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Specifically, what are we protecting?</span></span></h2><section><p><span>We are protecting a generic, trusted public communications system against stenography.

However, we do not aim to protect against nation-states or large-scale attacks as it is only practical to protect against variations of common stenography techniques. Furthermore, nation-states would have further (and likely more "legal") processes in place to gain access to privileged information already.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="what-methods-of-attack-do-we-prevent?-what-are-types-of-attacks-that-we-don&apos;t-prevent?"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>What methods of attack do we prevent?

As such, given we are protecting against common techniques (or variations thereof), we could limit ourselves to the resources that someone without a background in information theory could develop or use in a reasonable amount time. Such systems often come in the form of "binaries" which attackers could simply download and apply; other techniques could be implemented easily manually.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="what-are-our-resources?"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>What are our resources?</span></span></h2><section><p><span>Given we are assuming that the attacker's resources are mostly open source and publically available, we have the ability to reverse-engineer (or similar reverse-engineering tools already exist) to subvert the commonly-existing techniques. The only consideration is to prevent the existence of variants or otherwise manual-implemented "hacks"/changes which subvert typicaly detection systems.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="what-should-we-do?"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>What should we do?</span></span></h2><section><p><span>It is first important to collect a large sample of stenographical techniques which maybe used by attackers. When information is being passed, check for stenographical signatures that would be typical to the common techniques. Were there potential signs, it is possible to leverage existing reverse-engineering tools to extract the hidden information. Were the technique used be a variant of an existing technique, there likely is only small changes to the data structure which brute-force methods likely will provide an efficient mechanism to discover the changes.</span></p></section></div></div></div></div></article><div class="metapanel"><div class="metalabel">Contents</div><ol><li><a href="#common-stegnography-techniques">Common Stegnography Techniques</a><ol><li><a href="#lowest-noisy-bit">Lowest Noisy Bit</a></li><li><a href="#chaffing-and-winnowing">Chaffing and Winnowing</a></li><li><a href="#bpcs-steg">BPCS Steg</a></li></ol></li><li><a href="#threat-model-relating-to-steganography">Threat Model Relating to Steganography</a><ol><li><a href="#specifically,-what-are-we-protecting?">Specifically, what are we protecting?</a></li><li><a href="#who-are-we-protecting-it-from,-and-what-are-their-motivations?">Who are we protecting it from, and what are their motivations?</a></li><li><a href="#what-methods-of-attack-do-we-prevent?-what-are-types-of-attacks-that-we-don&apos;t-prevent?">What methods of attack do we prevent?
