(This pressure is created from the social dynamics of Salem and Puritan society as a whole.) However, in Act 3, the pressure is already off of Abigail; by the time Proctor accuses Abigail, she is already "cleared" in a way, and there is enough time for Abigail to not feel any pressure. This is the difference in the perceived "power" of Abigail between Act 1 and Act 3.</span></p></li></ul></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="analyze-and-evaluate-the-evolving-motifs-of-seeing-or-sight-and-knowing-or-knowledge-how-do-they-work-individually,-and-how-do-they-intertwine?"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Analyze and evaluate the evolving motifs of seeing or sight and knowing or knowledge.
