way in the morning, or at noon intermission or at sundown, < ploughboy =
any country boy The delicious singing of the mother, or of the young
wife at work, or of the girl sewing or washing, < "of" Each singing what

            World War II. < not here!</span></p><p><span>Dear Fellow Americans, < fellow, also an american I write this letter\\
Hoping times will be better\\
When this war\\
Is through.\\
I'm a Tan-skinned Yank < def? Driving a tank.\\
I ask, WILL V-DAY\\
BE ME-DAY, TOO? < included in the victory?</span></p><p><span>I wear a U. S. uniform.\\
I've done the enemy much harm,\\
I've driven back\\
The Germans and the Japs,\\
From Burma to the Rhine.\\
On every battle line,\\
I've dropped defeat\\
Into the Fascists' laps. < served americans cause</span></p><p><span>I am a Negro American < not just a "normal" american Out to defend my
land < </span><strong><span>my</span></strong><span> land Army, Navy, Air Corps---\\
I am there.\\
I take munitions through,\\
I fight---or stevedore, too.\\
I face death the same as you do  < fundemental unity Everywhere. < but
death is everywhere. iffy tho, cus so did the other side of the war?</span></p><p><span>I've seen my buddy lying\\
Where he fell.\\
I've watched him dying\\
I promised him that I would try\\
To make our land a land < land is not literally land, yet Where his son
could be a man---\\
And there'd be no Jim Crow birds\\
Left in our sky. < nice wordplay</span></p><p><span>So this is what I want to know:\\
When we see Victory's glow,\\
Will you still let old Jim Crow\\
Hold me back?\\
When all those foreign folks who've waited---\\
Italians, Chinese, Danes---are liberated.\\
Will I still be ill-fated\\
Because I'm black?</span></p><p><span>Here in my own, my native land, Will the Jim Crow laws still stand?\\
Will Dixie lynch me still < who? :: confederates When I return?\\
Or will you comrades in arms\\
From the factories and the farms,\\
Have learned what this war\\
Was fought for us to learn? < war was fought for them to learn? because
applied to others?</span></p><p><span>When I take off my uniform,\\
Will I be safe from harm---\\
Or will you do me\\
As the Germans did the Jews? < drawing similarity to nazis When I've
helped this world to save,\\
Shall I still be color's slave? < slave to color itself? Or will Victory
change\\
Your antiquated views?</span></p><p><span>You can't say I didn't fight\\
To smash the Fascists' might.\\
You can't say I wasn't with you\\
in each battle.\\
As a soldier, and a friend. < friend When this war comes to an end,\\
Will you herd me in a Jim Crow car\\
Like cattle?</span></p><p><span>Or will you stand up like a man\\
At home and take your stand < at home? about democracy? For Democracy? <
taking a stand for equal rights = a stand for democracy That's all I ask
of you.\\
When we lay the guns away\\
To celebrate\\
Our Victory Day\\
WILL V-DAY BE ME-DAY, TOO?\\
That's what I want to know.</span></p><p><span>            Sincerely,\\
