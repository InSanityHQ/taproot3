I interjected quickly, cutting Catherine off before
she could continue. "Who said I was crazy about him? I never was any
more crazy about him than I was about that man... there!"</span></p><p><span>I look around the room for someone to focus the attention onto. My
finger landed on a scrawny, empty, lamp-imitating fellow in the corner
of the room -- he seemed to blend in almost as just another piece of
furniture, hoping to be either ignored or thrown out onto the sidewalk.
His body stood slanted, as if physically repelled by my Tom! He was
certainly deserving of scorn. I pointed, and he feigned a pitiful
expression as if to make my pointing finger sheer off of him; I could
have done much better.</span></p><p><span>I needed the attention back on me: "The only </span><em><span>crazy</span></em><span> I was was when I
married him. I knew right away I made a mistake" I assured Tom. "He
borrowed somebody's best suit to get married in and never even told me
about it, and the man came after it one day when he was out." I looked
around, making sure everyone was listening. "'Oh, is that your suit?' I
said. 'This is the first I ever heard about it.' But I gave it to him
anyways." The story needed something else. "I lay down and cried to beat
the band all afternoon." I added, and the room looked at me
understandingly, right on cue.</span></p><p><span>"She really ought to get away from him" -- Catherine was trying to steal
back the spotlight -- "they've been living over that garage for eleven
years. And Tom's the first sweetie she ever had." My sister was right
about that. Tom promised the world to me, and I knew he could deliver.
If only he wanted too. And I was going to make him want to.</span></p><p><span>I called for another bottle of whiskey -- just one wasn't enough -- and
it was joyfully accepted by all. Except by my sister, once again.
Luckily she was ignored.</span></p><p><span>Tom rang for the janitor and sent him for some celebrated sandwiches,
which were a complete supper in themselves. I wanted to get out and walk
eastward toward the park through the soft twilight but each time I tried
to go I became entangled in some wild strident argument which pulled me
back, as if with ropes, into my chair. Yet high over the city our line
of yellow windows must have contributed their share of human secrecy to
the casual watcher in the darkening streets, and I was him too, looking
up and wondering. I was within and without, simultaneously enchanted and
repelled by the inexhaustible variety of life.</span></p><p><span>\[\frac{5+1}{P(B)+P(A)}\]</span></p></section></div></div></div></div></article><div class="metapanel"><div class="metalabel">Contents</div><ol><li><a href="#inclass-creative-writing">Inclass Creative Writing</a><ol><li><a href="#the-prompt:">the prompt:</a></li><li><a href="#idea">idea</a></li><li><a href="#writing">writing</a></li></ol></li></ol><div class="metalabel">Backlinks</div><ul class="firn-backlinks"><li class="firn-backlink"><a href="/english/english11/index">English 11 Master Index</a></li></ul></div></main></body></html>
