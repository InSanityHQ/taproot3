have contributed their share of human secrecy to the casual watcher in

unwilling descent into the life of a partygoer. Nick starts his
description by utilizing agency to juxtapose his rejection and
acceptance of this new life. He writes of how he "wanted to get out,"
but instead was "pulled [...] back, as if by ropes." Here, rejecting the
life of the partygoer, as symbolized by getting "out" of the party, is
described as something intrinsic to Nick. However, his acceptance is
described as extrinsic, something he doesn't have any agency over -- he
is "pulled" back by "ropes." Nick continues to describe the forces
keeping him at the party, narrating how he whenever he "tried to go" he
simply "became entangled." This contrast once again illustrates the
supposed dichotomy between Nicks intrinsic attempts at rejection and the
extrinsic forces leading to his acceptance.</span></p><p><span>Not only is Nick trying :: trying to leave, but his window for leaving
is closing as he continues to be entangled. - Twilight as the barrier
between the light and the dark - but the streets are darkening!</span></p></section></div></div></div></div></article><div class="metapanel"><div class="metalabel">Contents</div><ol><li><a href="#alright,-sounds-good">alright, sounds good.</a><ol><li><a href="#thinking">thinking</a></li><li><a href="#outlining">outlining</a></li><li><a href="#writing?">writing?</a></li></ol></li></ol><div class="metalabel">Backlinks</div><ul class="firn-backlinks"><li class="firn-backlink"><a href="/english/english11/index">English 11 Master Index</a></li></ul></div></main></body></html>
