lying down on the edge of the sidewalk (my friend Jack's first question:
"so, where you living now?"). We continued talking, and the man told us
his story. He and his brother (lying down beside him) had traveled here
using their stimulus check. Where they came from -- I think it was
Illinois -- was too rainy. He told us how he couldn't get a job because
he didn't have an ID, and had been trying to get one for quite some
time. His lucky break was that his mom finally responded, allowing him
to hopefully get his ID. Having experience in the field, he aspired to
be a plumber. He told us that his brother worked making wings at a
restaurant. They told us what they had learned about being homeless:
living downtown was a bad idea, because that was where all the drug
addicts were. Living on Haight, however, had a lot of drama -- everyone
was constantly gossiping. But both were better than where they came
from. They said that everyone there went to jail: all their friends,
family, even those who "didn't even take any drugs or drink." They
explained how the private prisons made a profit by having more inmates,
leading them to round up the less fortunate and imprison them all. Being
in and out of jail became simply a fact of life. We chatted about the
weather, the field trip, and some politics. Then, we thanked him for his
time, and went on with our field trip. Right before we left, he called
out, "I'm Alex!"</span></p><p><span>Alex was kind, bright, and remarkably personable. But he was living on
the street. With different circumstances, he would have fit right in
with us Nueva kids. Alex's biggest aspirations were to be a plumber,
because that was all he was allowed to aspire for. Us Nueva students are
allowed to aspire for so much more, not because we are smarter, not
because we are better, but because we were simply born with different
circumstances. Blaming the homeless for their circumstances is a
misconception. Our society wants badly to erase problems by calling the
less fortunate inherently lesser. Haight-Ashbury is a place where those
erased from moral concern through illusions of superiority have
coalesced, slowly shattering these illusionary band-aids while these
marginalized groups have done anything but be lesser. Artwork, color,
and history saturate every inch of Haight-Ashbury. Its immense cultural
innovation has forced it back into public eye, no longer able to be
discounted.</span></p><p><span>But Alex's family is still imprisoned, and he has cardboard for a bed.</span></p></section></div></div></div></article><div class="metapanel"><div class="metalabel">Contents</div><ol><li><a href="#haight-ashbury">Haight-Ashbury</a></li></ol><div class="metalabel">Backlinks</div></div></main></body></html>
