Then she remembered the mustangs she
    had read about in National Geographic. The Spaniards had brought
    them over hundreds of years ago and now there were thousands of
    horses just roaming around, wild. Every autumn they came down from
    the hills to graze on the high desert plains. If a cowboy needed a
    new horse all he had to do was go out into the desert and get
    himself one. It was as simple as that. She imagined a cowboy
    snapping his fingers and a horse, a wild white stallion, galloping
    up to him in a cloud of hot swirling dust.</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><span>p2</span></p><ul><li><p><span>It had begun, she was almost sure of it, at Tanforan. All summer
    long they had lived in the old horse stalls in the stables behind
    the racetrack.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Some of the horse meat, she explained, came from the racetrack. If a
    horse went down with a broken leg they destroyed it after the race
    and sent it to the cannery. But most of the horse meat came from
    wild horses.</span></p></li><li><p><span>"They round them up in the desert," she said, "and then they shoot
    them." She asked if he remembered the wild mustangs they had seen
    through the window of the train and he said that he did. They had
    long black tails and dark flowing manes and he had watched them
    galloping in the moonlight across the flat dusty plain and then for
    three nights in a row he had dreamed of them.</span></p></li><li><p><span>She pulled back the shade and looked out into the black Nevada night
    and saw a herd of wild mustangs galloping across the desert. The sky
    was lit up by the moon and the dark bodies of the horses were
    drifting and turning in the moonlight and wherever they went they
    left behind great billowing clouds of dust as proof of their
    passage. The girl lifted the shade and pulled her brother to the
    window and pressed his face gently to the glass and when he saw the
    mustangs with their long legs and their flying manes and their sleek
    brown coats he let out a low moan that sounded like a cry of pain
    but was not. He watched the horses as they galloped toward the
    mountains and he said, very softly, "They are going away."</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><span>p3</span></p><ul><li><p><span>(in the midst of his stay) "Once he came across a horse skull
    bleached white by the sun."</span></p></li><li><p><span>"The horse meat." "What about it?" "Where do they get it?" She
    puckered her lips. "From horses." "What kind?" She looked at him in
    the mirror. "The dead kind."</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><span>conclusion</span></p><ul><li><p><span>One night when the flies were very bad and they could not sleep he
    had sat up suddenly in his cot and told her that when he grew up he
    wanted to be a jockey. The boy had never been on a horse before in
    his life. "A jockey is a small man," she had said to him. "Do you
    want to grow up to be a small man?" He could not make up his mind.
    Did he want to ride the horses? He did. Did he want to be a small
    man? He did not. "Ride horses!" Mr. Okamura had shouted from the
    stall on the other side of the partition. "Eat lots, grow up to be
    big American boy!"</span></p></li><li><p><span>"HE COULD COME BACK on a horse"</span></p></li></ul></li></ul></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="writing!"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>writing!</span></span></h2><section><p><span>potential? Horses --- and the evolution of their treatment throughout
the novel --- serve as a symbolic representation of Japanese Americans.</span></p><p><span>{INTRO} Horses serve as a symbolic representation of the rapidly
changing experiences of being Japanese in America.</span></p><p><span>Initially in the novel, horses are portrayed as successful immigrants,
reflecting the experience of Japanese Americans prior to the war. The
first characterization of horses in </span><em><span>When the Emperor was Divine</span></em><span> takes
place on the train. While reminiscing about the past, the girl remembers
"the mustangs she had read about in National Geographic." She recalls
that "the Spaniards had brought them over hundreds of years ago," and
now "there were thousands of horses just roaming around, wild." Horses,
after immigrating far in the past, now numbered in the "thousands,"
thriving and free. Furthermore, the girl mentions "mustangs"
specifically, a symbol of freedom and elegance especially prominent
during the era of cowboy media. However, not only are horses free, but
also available to meet the needs of the cowboys: "If a cowboy needed a
new horse all he had to do was go out into the desert and get himself
one. It was as simple as that." With cowboys serving as the prototypical
embodiment of the American, this scenario reflects another common aspect
of being an immigrant: forced to be readily available to meet the needs
of the white American. The initial mention of horses reflects the
initial state of Japanese Americans, however this depiction as free,
prosperous, and successful immigrants does not last.</span></p><p><span>Horses are next depicted as first rounded up and then sent away. Just
after Evacuation Order #19, was given, The Tanforan Racetrack located in
San Bruno was repurposed as a temporary holding facility for Japanese
Americans while they were being collected. For long stretches of time,
Japanese Americans were forced to live "in the old horse stalls in the
stables behind the racetrack." Just like the horses who were "round[ed]
up in the desert," Japanese Americans were gathered and then sent to
live in the horse stables. After living in the horse stables, Japanese
Americans were sent away to internment camps on trains. During the train
ride depicted in the novel, the girl looks outside her window and sees
"a herd of wild mustangs galloping across the desert." After showing her
brother, the brother softly whispers: "They are going away." Just like
the horses</span></p></section></div></div></div></div></article><div class="metapanel"><div class="metalabel">Contents</div><ol><li><a href="#when-the-emperor-was-divine,-inclass">When the Emperor Was Divine, inclass</a><ol><li><a href="#outlinin">outlinin</a></li><li><a href="#qoute-bin">qoute bin</a></li><li><a href="#writing!">writing!</a></li></ol></li></ol><div class="metalabel">Backlinks</div><ul class="firn-backlinks"><li class="firn-backlink"><a href="/english/english11/index">English 11 Master Index</a></li></ul></div></main></body></html>
