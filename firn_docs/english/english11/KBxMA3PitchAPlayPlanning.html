Lets just, frickin, go?</span></span></h2><section><p><span>Our modern lifestyle has undergone a massive shift in the way we
interact with the world. We have moved away from the world of the
physical and into the realm of the digital, a phenomenon represented
perhaps most clearly in the events of the last year and a half. However,
while massively altering, this medium shift still allows the same
fundamental evils to exploit our society. After a medium shift, these
evils can reemerge in a new form only evident as a reconstruction of its
previous incarnation upon closer inspection. Without this inspection --
tying modern incarnations to previous ones -- we are doomed to fall
victim to the same traps. One such tie is what this play is meant to
illuminate: modern day social media companies like Facebook to old
tobacco companies.</span></p><p><span>Social media companies like Facebook operate within the same fundamental
evil as old tobacco companies: the economy of addiction. This parallel
has become increasingly clear in light of recent events due to Frances
Haugen, a data scientist turned</span><a class="firn-external" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-misinformation-public-60-minutes-2021-10-03/" target="_blank">whistleblower</a><span>
at Facebook. Bar the change in medium, Frances Haugen's findings in 2021
are almost an exact match to</span><a class="firn-external" href="https://www.jeffreywigand.com/60minutes.php" target="_blank">Jeffrey Wigand's
findings</a><span> in 1996. This play hopes to explore and articulate the modern
day situation with Haugen and Facebook through its parallel with big
tobacco and Wigand. The fundamental parallel it hopes to illuminate is
how both industries rely on grabbing the populaces attention, and thus,
intentionally turned to utilizing addiction for their own self
interests. As revealed by Wigand, big tobacco harnessed the power of
addiction by using toxic chemicals like ammonia to increase the</span><a class="firn-external" href="https://truthinitiative.org/research-resources/harmful-effects-tobacco/how-big-tobacco-made-cigarettes-more-addictive" target="_blank">addictiveness
of nicotine</a><span>, just as Facebook optimizes its algorithm to create
addicting reward cycles and increase app interaction, harming the health
of its users.</span></p><p><span>The play would explore this parallel by following Wigand's life --
navigating through bureaucracy, ethics, and death threats -- up until
just before his interview on 60 minutes revealing the truths about big
tobacco. Wigand's findings would be reflected by intermittent scenes of
transient characters, each suffering from the effects of tobacco. These
characters are transient to represent the ubiquity of tobaccos negative
effects, placing its exploitation on a societal level instead of an
individual level. This alternating between the suffering and distraught
lives of big tobbaco's victims and Wigand's navigation through the elite
and machevelion world of business serves to instill a sense of organized
dread and urgency in the audience, hopefully inspiring change.</span></p><p><span>STAGE DIRECTIONS:</span></p><p><span>The curtain rises on two separated scenes, each lit with soft
silhouetting light. Stage left is lit in red, while stage right is lit
in blue. Stage left becomes fully illuminated in now sickly fluorescent
light, with low red lights casting long diagonal shadows. Revealed is a
glimmering lab -- immaculate, and reeking of anxiety. There are no
windows. Beakers and tools line winding and cramped pathways through the
lab, forming a veritable maze of unknown potentials. Every item on the
walls and tables lie neatly organized yet on the brink of chaos, waiting
for a small accident to send them all into disarray. A pile of torn off
warning labels are stacked neatly on the side of the scene, illuminated
in red.</span></p><p><span>The left side of the stage recedes into beckoning red darkness, while
the right becomes illuminated in a soft sky-blue. Large rusted shut
windows lie just out of reach near the ceiling above unused and crooked
shelves. A small living room strewn with miscellaneous and unorganized
living items is revealed. One sun-baked and deteriorated expensive shoe
collects dust by the door, the other still sitting in a shoe box to the
right patiently waiting its turn. A broom stands solemnly defeated
against the back wall, a large pile of used cigarettes lying at its
feet. The rest of room is scattered with cigarettes and coated in dust,
except for a well overworn sofa chair sitting in the dead center of the
room.</span></p><p><span>A man seemingly much older than he is sits solemnly, imprisoned to his
once comfortable sofa chair. He looks to two young children, accompanied
by a young woman, waiting just inside the door. He collects his focus,
and with all his efforts, tries to speak, only to be met with an array
of coughs. The young woman looks on with a defeated pity -- not concern.
Increasingly intense coughing fits echo as the man desperately tried to
speak to his visitors, and the lights shift back to the lab. Two men
stand carefully, about to engage in conversation.</span></p><p><span>INTRODUCTION:</span></p><p><span>JEFFERY WIGAND is a confident, comfortable family man who sits at a well
paying job in the Brown and Williamson Tobacco Corporation. He exudes a
casual kindness which gains him the respect of his peers. While
attempting to be an ethical man, WIGAND views his first priority as his
family -- something he isn't wiling to risk for anything. Despite his
aged white hair, WIGAND approaches conversation with vigor, always
doubting his own opinions and seeking help from others. WIGAND's success
thus far has stemmed from a history of following the road laid out for
him by society, instilling WIGAND with a sense of naive optimism and
almost blind trust. Internally, WIGAND fears his own curiosity, viewing
it as a beast that needs to be tamed lest it erode his naive,
optimistic, and trusting view of the world he has surrounded himself
with.</span></p><p><span>THOMAS SANDEFUR is an intensly charasmatic buisnessman</span></p></section></div></div></div></div></article><div class="metapanel"><div class="metalabel">Contents</div><ol><li><a href="#pitch-a-play">Pitch A Play</a><ol><li><a href="#meta-outline">Meta Outline</a></li><li><a href="#parrelels!">parrelels!</a></li></ol></li><li><a href="#writing?-lets-just,-frickin,-go?">Writing?
