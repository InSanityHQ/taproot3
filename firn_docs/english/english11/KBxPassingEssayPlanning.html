in relation to the following texts: The Great Gatsby and Passing. Your
essay should have a clear claim in which you define how you are
interpreting the concept of "passing" and how it relates to the two
works you are comparing. You can define "passing" in terms of race,
class, the American Dream, sexuality, the role of the narrator,
geography, etc. Be sure that the comparison between the two texts is
justified and makes sense. Throughout your discussion, use evidence from
the texts and analyze that evidence to support your assertions. If you
are looking for ways to stretch your writing, you may use literary
criticism (secondary sources) if you wish, but you do not have to.</span></p></section><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="rough-idea"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>rough idea</span></span></h2><section><p><span>compare contrast!</span></p><ul><li><p><span>compare:</span></p><ul><li><p><span>both have unreliable narrator</span></p></li></ul></li></ul><p><span>lose perspective -> unreliable narrator</span></p><p><span>"living in the divide"</span></p><p><span>we are unsure, just like the characters - contrast: - told you can, but

Scott Fitzgerald and </span><em><span>Passing</span></em><span> by Nella Larsen
both explore the concept of passing, though in different realms. INTRO
The nature of passing is opposite in Fitzgerald's </span><em><span>The Great Gatsby</span></em><span> and
Nella Larsen's </span><em><span>Passing</span></em><span>, yet in both novels, passing manifests itself
in the creation of an unreliable narrator.</span></p><p><span>In the world of </span><em><span>The Great Gatsby</span></em><span>, passing is a false promise: the
society tells its members that they can pass, but they cannot.
Fitzgerald constructs an intricate world set during the Roaring
Twenties, a time where the pursuit of and belief in the American Dream
was more widespread than ever. Here, the American Dream -- and the
concept of passing -- center around the construct of social class. To
pass in </span><em><span>The Great Gatsby</span></em><span> is to transcend one's social class, something
promised by the American Dream if one put in sufficient effort. This
pursuit of the American Dream through hard work is perhaps most evident
in Gatsby's revered schedule:</span></p><p><span>This schedule is even said to "show you" Gatsby's "big future in front
of him," and how he was "bound to get ahead" -- or, pass (Fitzgerald
132). However, this societal promise of passing that Fitzgerald's
characters hold so dear is ultimately shown to be a lie. Even Gatsby
never truly joins the ranks of the elite, instead acting as a mysterious
outsider surrounded by rumors. He is such an outcast that skepticism of
his facade is taken "for granted" (Fitzgerald 37). In the end, despite
all his hard work towards passing, Gatsby is left with nothing but a
"dead dream [...] trying to touch what was no longer tangible,
struggling unhappily" (Fitzgerald 103). Myrtle Wilson has a similar
fate, trying desperately to pass only to be struck dead due to her dream
itself. The book concludes with the words "so we beat on," despite
passing constantly "elud[ing] us" (Fitzgerald 138). Here, Nick uses the
word "we" to refer to the characters in the novel, but Fitzgerald uses
the word "we" to refer to the reader and American society at large,
claiming that this false promise of passing operates at a societal level
-- in and out of the world of fiction.</span></p><p><span>Conversely, in Nella Larsen's </span><em><span>Passing</span></em><span>, the society tells its members
that they cannot pass even though they can. The societal view of race --
one not held by our protagonists -- is that it is constant, discrete,
and unchanging. Membership in a race is binary, something that one can
"draw the line at" due to "one or two per cent" (Larsen 29). This
societal view of passing across race is opposite the societal view of
passing across social class in </span><em><span>The Great Gatsby</span></em><span>, where passing is at
the core of the cultural zeitgeist</span></p></section></div></div></div></div></article><div class="metapanel"><div class="metalabel">Contents</div><ol><li><a href="#passing-project!">passing project!</a><ol><li><a href="#rough-idea">rough idea</a></li><li><a href="#outlinin">outlinin</a></li><li><a href="#comin-back!">comin back!</a></li><li><a href="#qoute-bin">qoute bin</a><ol><li><a href="#outlining-timeline">outlining timeline</a></li></ol></li><li><a href="#writing-time">writing time</a></li></ol></li></ol><div class="metalabel">Backlinks</div><ul class="firn-backlinks"><li class="firn-backlink"><a href="/english/english11/index">English 11 Master Index</a></li></ul></div></main></body></html>
