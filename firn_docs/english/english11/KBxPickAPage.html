F*ck it.</span></span></h2><section><p><span>At the beginning of </span><em><span>Fences</span></em><span> second act, August Wilson uses metaphor to
communicate the beginnings of Cory's shift in viewpoint towards his
father. The scene begins with Cory pondering his identity with respect
to his father's, Troy. Cory, just having been denied by his father to
pursue his own dreams, stands at the last shred of evidence of Troy's
now broken dreams. He is "at the tree hitting the ball with the bat,"
engaging in a broken form of baseball -- the representation of his
fathers childhood dreams. Cory is not playing baseball, he is merely
"hitting the ball with the bat," a shallow imitation of the true game.
This imitation is physically attached to "the tree," an embodiment of
unnoticeably slow change and growth. The tree's progress seems to
stagnate, its growth only apparent when looked for. This pattern of
growth reflects the societal progress which Troy is not willing to look
for despite his son's pleading. Instead, Troy falls into the illusion of
stagnation and tells Cory to quit pursuing his dreams. After hearing
this message, Cory's alignment with his father starts to shift: "he
tries to mimic TROY, but his swing is awkward, less sure." Cory is
making an active, conscious effort to be like his father. He does not
simply mimic Troy, but rather he "tries to" mimic Troy. However, he is
no longer confident about wanting to be like his father. Instead, he
mimics awkwardly, and is "less sure" than his father. Cory has begun his
shift into rejecting his father as his role model. The stage directions
end with Rose entering "from the house," representing how Rose is an
extension of Troys stagnation. Rose then makes a mundane request to
Cory, to which he responds "I ain't quitting the team. I don't care what
Poppa say." Cory's non sequitur of a response further indicates his
state of thought and uncertainty. Despite his seemingly matter-of-fact
statement, he is truly looking to his mother for support and validation
in the rejection of his fathers wishes. However, in Cory's rejection of
his father, he is truly becoming more like him. Just as Troy rejected
his father and chose to pursue his sports dreams, Cory is now rejecting
his father to pursue his similar dreams, veering to follow in Troys
footsteps. Cory is shifting from trying to be like his father to being
like his father by rejecting him. This nuanced shift is a microcosm of
the larger theme of generational shift and boundaries that inhabit the
play. However, this shift is not complete. While Cory claims to not
"care what Poppa say," he mimics Troy only seconds earlier. Cory of
course does end up quitting the team in accordance with Troy's wishes.</span></p><p><span>This rejection is still unclear as In rejecting Troy, Cory is becoming
more like him? Setting himself up to follow in his footsteps Cory is
still in a transition phase, he has not yet fully distanced himself from
his father? Troy rejected his father and pursued sports, just like Cory
is rejecting his father to pursue sports.</span></p><p><span>Inherent in Cory's rejection of his father as a role model is Cory's
repetition of his father's life, illuminating the nuance in generational
differences through the play.</span></p></section></div></div></div></div></article><div class="metapanel"><div class="metalabel">Contents</div><ol><li><a href="#pick-a-page!">Pick a Page!</a><ol><li><a href="#major-themes:">major themes:</a></li><li><a href="#worthy-of-analysis:">worthy of analysis:</a></li></ol></li><li><a href="#writing-f*ck-it">Writing.
