\subsubsection{general crises in the balkans}
\label{sec:org5b85274}
\begin{enumerate}
\item geographic background
\label{sec:org60a7cb9}
\begin{enumerate}
\item ottoman empire, almost dissolved, 'still held a band of territory from Constantinople westward to the Adriatic'
\label{sec:org1e1290f}
\item south lay an indpendent greece, north had bulgarea and romania
\label{sec:orge005748}
\item small and landlocked serbia and bosnia-herzegovinia to the west
\label{sec:org7e6cd70}
\begin{enumerate}
\item belonged legally to turkey but occupied and adminstered by austria since 1878
\label{sec:org7dd227b}
\end{enumerate}
\item within the austro-hungarian empire next to bosnia on the north and west was croatia and slovenia
\label{sec:org049b27b}
\end{enumerate}
\item cultural division
\label{sec:org52ac651}
\begin{enumerate}
\item altho Serbs, Bosnians, Croats, and Slovens all basically spoke Serbo-Croation, Serbs and Bosnians wrote eastern/Cyrillic while the Croats and Slovenes wrote with the western/roman alphabet
\label{sec:org531f434}
\item caused by diff in religion: Slovenes and Croats were Roman Catholic, and affiliated with the west. Serbs and 'many Bosnians' were Eastern Orthodox and closer to Russia
\label{sec:orgafd8e05}
\item also many Muslim Slaves in Bosnia converted 'during the Ottoman domination'
\label{sec:org49a60a2}
\end{enumerate}
\item upset slavs
\label{sec:org03b9abe}
\begin{enumerate}
\item "During the Slavic Revival, which emphasized language, many of these peoples felt like one people, the Yugoslavs (South Slavs)"
\label{sec:orgcd3154c}
\item Dual Monarchy formed in 1867 -> Slavs of the Hasburg empire subordinate to German Austrians and Hungarian Magyars
\label{sec:org5c53301}
\item radical Slav nationalists fed up of dual monachry by 1900, wanted indpendent Yugoslavia
\label{sec:org220aec3}
\item 'Concretely, this meant that an element of the Austro-Hungarian population (the Croatian and Slovenian nationalists) wanted to get out and join with Serbia across the border).
\label{sec:org2eb6f82}
\end{enumerate}
\item events that set things off 'brought to a boil in 1908 by'
\label{sec:org4abfa19}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Young Turks carried through a revolution, 'obliged the sultan to restore the liberal parliamentary constitution of 1876', and tried to stop the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire by trying to get delegates from Bulgaria and Bosnia to set in the new Ottoman Parliament
\label{sec:org0942ad8}
\item Russia temporarily gave up on the Far East and wanted control of Constantinople
\label{sec:org9845806}
\item Austria wanted full annexation of Bosnia to discourage 'Pan-Yugoslav ideas?'
\label{sec:org59803f9}
\item young Turks strengthened Ottoman Empire, then Austria would not get Bosnia, and Russians not Constantinople (Austria/Russia don't want Ottoman Empire strengthened)
\label{sec:orga684ed8}
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{first balkan crisis}
\label{sec:org88a9fcf}
\begin{enumerate}
\item austrian and russian foreign ministers secretly agreed in 1908 at Buchlau to call an international confrence
\label{sec:org9a649fd}
\begin{enumerate}
\item where russia would favor austrian annexation of bosnia, and austria would support the opening of the Straits to Russian warships
\label{sec:org5c7dfbe}
\end{enumerate}
\item Austria immediately 'proclaimed the annexation of Bosnia without more ado'
\label{sec:org4e532a1}
\begin{enumerate}
\item -> infuriated the Serbs, who wanted Bosnia
\label{sec:orgd58a46d}
\end{enumerate}
\item later that year (1908), Bulgaria became independent and Crete joined Greece.
\label{sec:org609e6c9}
\begin{enumerate}
\item russians never got constantinople, russia's allies (britain and and france) didn't back them
\label{sec:org5770665}
\end{enumerate}
\item basically, slavs got stepped on
\label{sec:org8e1102b}
\end{enumerate}

\label{sec:org919e02b}
\subsubsection{leaders believed that new technologies favored the offensive}
\label{sec:org6540642}
\subsubsection{formalizing the problem}
\label{sec:org23c6ffa}
\begin{enumerate}
\item states can preempt or defend
\label{sec:org6859ff3}
\item outcomes
\label{sec:org7f22118}
\begin{enumerate}
\item best: i preempt, you defend (surprised)
\label{sec:orgc912c06}
\item both defend (peace)
\label{sec:org77f2c98}
\item both preempt (war)
\label{sec:org86dd800}
\item i defend, you preempt (bad news bears for me)
\label{sec:orga3e53c6}
\item \textbf{assumption is that preemption is better than defenese}
\label{sec:org24d98be}
\end{enumerate}
\item preempting vs defending is the prisoners dilemma
\label{sec:org180abcc}
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{from any one perspective, preempting is always better than defending regardless of the other person}
\label{sec:org3849830}
\subsubsection{how could this have been avoided}
\label{sec:orgb4892ed}
\begin{enumerate}
\item third party to hold everyone accountable/defensive
\label{sec:org2407c89}
\item mutually assured destruction
\label{sec:org413d0bc}
\item existing alliances
\label{sec:org47455bf}
\item a balancer like the US could have mediated
\label{sec:org463979c}
\end{enumerate}
