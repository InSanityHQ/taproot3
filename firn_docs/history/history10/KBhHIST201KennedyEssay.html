sketches out an explanation of why the Ming Dynasty was, on the one hand
powerful and prosperous, but ultimately was "a country which had turned
in on itself" and subject to "steady relative decline." Mann, in his
chapter on the Ming trade, gives the reader a lot more detail on the
nuances of Ming history in this period. Putting Kennedy and Mann into
dialogue, does Kennedy's argument still hold up? In your essay, argue
for or against Kennedy's argument using the details of Ming history
