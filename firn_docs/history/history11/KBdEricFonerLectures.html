They worked in tandem to change the landscape of the Antebellum period. For example, the Eerie Canal enabled farmers to get goods to other places in the US. This facilitated a shift from a self-subsisting economy to a more market-oriented economy. The invention of steamboats enabled the expansion of the agricultural market. Another example is the introduction of factories.</span></p><p><span>Many of the political issues of the Antebellum period had to do with the Market Revolution:</span></p><ul><li><p><span>Banking</span></p></li><li><p><span>Free Trade</span></p></li><li><p><span>Protective tariffs</span></p></li><li><p><span>Internal improvement</span></p></li></ul><p><span>Much of these "problems" originated in the Antebellum period.</span></p><p><span>Another "thing" that happened in the Antebellum period was the "rise of political democracy" (based on "universal white male suffrage"). A large percentage of the population was able to vote. Democracy became the defining characteristic of America.</span></p><p><span>Much of politics were grassroots.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="the-cotton-kingdom"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>The Cotton Kingdom</span></span></h1><section><p><span>Slavery was actually dying out in Antebellum Period but Industrial Revolution in England made cotton valuable; American South monopoly of cotton. Cotton gin sped up cotton harvesting and made slavery worse.</span></p><p><span>Internal slave trade replaces international slave trade. Creation of Cotton Kingdom (Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas): Heartland of slavery.</span></p><p><u><span>"Cotton is King"</span></u><span>: Key commodity of world trade in 19th century, was like oil.</span></p><p><span>Entire nation was benefitting from cotton trade; made up about </span><strong><span>50%</span></strong><span> of profits. New York was centrally involved; merchants controlled shipping of cotton to Europe; prosperity tied to cotton.

More than population of US when nation founded. Largest amount came from Ireland; also England, Scotland, Germany, Scandinavia (so called old immigration)</span></p><p><span>Most immigrants moved to North; didn't want to compete with slave labor.
