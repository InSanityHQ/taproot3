The Glorious Revolution in 1688 established parliament as being the dominant ruling force in England, and as a result, concepts such as natural rights and Locke's idea of social contracts permeated throughout the English ideological zeitgeist. Despite this widespread adoption of these concepts, the radical Whigs took things further by emphasizing the importance of these concepts beyond that given by the mainstream. Radical Whig writers such as Trenchad, Gordon, and Bolingbroke wrote of the ostensive democratic façade that parliament hid behind to mask their corruption, and urged for restrictions on the powers of parliament by one way or another. These ideas, although popular within niche circles, never gained prominence within Britain; they were radical ideas for the time, after all. However, they did gain traction among another population: Colonists in America. The large population of land-owning individuals and farmers, as well as a weak presence of religious authority induced by religious diversity in the Colonies, made the Colonist populace largely accepting of the imported radical Whig ideals from Britain, and the ideology spread throughout the Colonies throughout the 18th century.</span></p><p><span>The unified colonial movement itself, meanwhile, was the result of the boycott movement in the 1760's.
After a worsening of finances after the French–Indian War, the English government looked at the Colonies as an untapped revenue source to help pay off the debts they accrued. In 1765, the Stamp Act was passed. It introduced a tax levied on all official documents, similar to existing laws on documents in England. The tax was viewed negatively by Colonists; some interpreted it as a sign that </span><code>Baubles</code><span>, whereas others interpreted it as </span><code>Britain wants to subjugate colonists</code><span>. Either way, the colonists</span></p><p><span>Prior to the boycotts, unity between the 13 British colonies in America was thought of being unattainabe. The primary reason for this sentiment was the conception that the culture of the colonies differed too greatly between each other to lead to unity. This sentiment was widespread among Englishmen and Colonists alike; Thomas Pownall, the former royal governer of Massachusetts, is quoted as claiming that colonists' "mental horizons were too narrow, too much the product of local history and culture, for them ever to cooperate with those who happened to live in other provinces." However, this would change after the boycotts.</span></p><p><span>Without the libertarian ideals that spread among the colonies in early 18th century, the boycott movement would not have been conceived, much less enacted upon.</span></p><p><span>The cause for the American Revolution can be </span><code>interpreted</code><span> as a combination of both economic and ideological factors, which interlaced with each other to create the unique environment in which the American Revolution took place.

The boycott movement against British goods was a characteristically libertarian reaction to perceived British tyranny. The origins of the boycott movement could be traced back to the passing of the Stamp Act in 1765, after which colonists became subject to laws similar to those in Britain that saw the taxation of official documents.</span><code>Colonists viewed the passing the Stamp Act as a sign of Britain's expectation of</code><span>
