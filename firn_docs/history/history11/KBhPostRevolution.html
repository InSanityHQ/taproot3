Having been an usually moderate framer, Dickinson's chief concerns surrounds that of the representation that a small state Delaware gets in the larger federal government. The Connecticut compromise --- a bicameral plan for the legislature --- was successfully introduced into the Constitution, which in kind signifies the rhetorical success of Dickinson. Although he did not achieve the full halt of the slave trade as he wished, Dickinson nevertheless supported the passage of the constitution and thought of the slave trade as a side agitation that could be addressed later.</span></p></li><li><p><span>I agree that absolute democracy, as Latham highlighted, cannot practically be achieved while respecting the conflicting wishes of all classes (i.e. respecting freedom vs. regulating security/trade, etc.) --- paradoxically preventing the "democratic" resolution that respects the opinions of both. However, I don't necessarily agree with the frame of the ratification of the constitution as a light coup d'etat. The chaotic start of the United States signifies the exploration of a sense of unknown, and not necessarily a systemic failure. The Constitution simply takes the unreconcilable issues with the previous system in perspective and syntheses a largely-improved program that, while respecting the democratic ideals of the original declaration, revises the terms of union to actually be practical.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Being in and reaping the benefits of the federalist system in the United States, I have a very biased lens with respect to how an anti-federalist society would result. What I found very interesting about Federalist Paper 10, however, is its claim that a larger and purely-democratic society is susceptible to functioning. In the current American system, some degree factioning may actually help expedite the deadlock to which the Federalist-driven two-party system has granted. I nevertheless fully agree with the idea that Federalism perhaps increases central executor space and allows the protection of minority opinions. Hence, although a combination of Federalism with a degree of freedom maybe helpful for the American landscape, the current system is likely one of the best to maintain governmental function.</span></p></li></ol></section></div></div></div></article><div class="metapanel"><div class="metalabel">Contents</div><ol><li><a href="#the-articles-of-confederation-sucked,-so-we-don&apos;t-talk-about-it">The Articles of Confederation Sucked, so We Don't talk about it</a></li><li><a href="#writing-the-constitution">Writing the Constitution</a><ol><li><a href="#on-slavery">On Slavery</a></li><li><a href="#on-states">On States</a></li></ol></li><li><a href="#the-plan-of-the-government">The Plan of the Government</a><ol><li><a href="#we-the-people">We the People</a></li><li><a href="#key-concepts-of-the-constitution">Key Concepts of the Constitution</a><ol><li><a href="#three-branches">Three Branches</a></li><li><a href="#checks-and-balances">Checks and Balances</a></li><li><a href="#federalism">Federalism</a><ol><li><a href="#national">National</a></li><li><a href="#state">State</a></li></ol></li><li><a href="#changes-and-amendments">Changes and Amendments</a></li></ol></li><li><a href="#roles-for-the-branches-of-government">Roles for the Branches of Government</a><ol><li><a href="#the-legislature">The Legislature</a></li><li><a href="#executive-branch">Executive Branch</a></li><li><a href="#judicial">Judicial</a><ol><li><a href="#laws-vs-amendments">Laws vs. Amendments</a></li></ol></li></ol></li><li><a href="#federalism">Federalism</a><ol><li><a href="#&quot;delegated-powers&quot;:-national">"Delegated Powers": National</a></li><li><a href="#&quot;concurrent-powers&quot;:-both">"Concurrent Powers": Both</a></li><li><a href="#state-powers-(tbd,-didn&apos;t-have-time)">State Powers (TBD, didn't have time)</a></li></ol></li><li><a href="#ratifying">Ratifying</a></li></ol></li><li><a href="#readings-about-the-constitution">Readings about the constitution</a></li></ol><div class="metalabel">Backlinks</div></div></main></body></html>
