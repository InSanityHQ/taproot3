He had a lot of
massive impacts, but one of his largest is how he shifted the very
framework that politics operate in. He shifted America into the system
of "Party Politics." To understand how this happened and what this means
we first have to understand who Jackson actually is.</span></p><p><span>WHO WAS ANDREW JACKSON</span></p><ul><li><p><span>Boy Soldier during the American revolution</span></p><ul><li><p><span>Slash on his head from being captured by the British</span></p></li><li><p><span>Continued as a warrior,</span></p></li><li><p><span>got very popular because of it</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><span>ended up running for president</span></p></li><li><p><span>Represented himself as</span></p><ul><li><p><span>a fighter, more importantly</span></p></li><li><p><span>a man of people, not of the elite.</span></p></li><li><p><span>slash symbolized how he pulled himself up from his bootstraps</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><span>ran for president in 1824</span></p><ul><li><p><span>Campaigning to the common people, Andrew Jackson won the popular
    vote</span></p><ul><li><p><span>and he also got the most electoral votes</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><span>but since he ran against three other guys, he actully didn't get the
    majority</span></p><ul><li><p><span>and the constitution requires a majority of electoral votes</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><span>this means, that the decision goes to the house of representatives</span></p><ul><li><p><span>they vote, and president john quincy adams gets elected</span></p></li><li><p><span>and adams makes henry clay his secretary of state.</span></p></li><li><p><span>henry clay was the speaker of the house of representatives</span></p></li><li><p><span>kinda fishy...</span></p></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p><span>corrupt bargain!</span></p><ul><li><p><span>supporters were in outrage</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><span>1828, jackson ran again, and he did it differently this time.</span></p><ul><li><p><span>slander, mudslinging</span></p></li><li><p><span>changed politics into the idea of "running for president" and self
