Cambrian explosion of art. The massive diversity I've seen in the works
of artists such as Langston Hughes, Wallace Thurman, Jean Toomer, and
Zora Neale Hurston is just astonishing. However, it wasn't just art that
rapidly developed, but also the acceptance of this art in popular
culture. This style and hipness of this art led to many minorities being
able to express themselves, in spite of the racial prejudice at the
time. The diversity in artwork began to reflect the diversity in culture
that America prides itself for. Art allowed for the ethnic minorities to
be accepted, whereas without this art, America might have continued in
its exclusive way for many more years. However, much of the artwork I've
seen is still frighteningly relevant today -- Langston Hughes and Nella
Larsen's works still shed applicable commentary on modern day society.
They express the racial prejudices, sexual differences, and cultural
clashing that still adds to todays social injustices. Despite the
passing of nearly a century, there are symbols and situations in
Langston Hughes writings that still have strong resonance today.</span></p></section></div></div></div></article><div class="metapanel"><div class="metalabel">Contents</div><ol><li><a href="#harlem-renaissance---self-guided-tour:-art,-music,-history,-injustice">Harlem Renaissance - Self Guided Tour: Art, Music, History, Injustice</a></li></ol><div class="metalabel">Backlinks</div><ul class="firn-backlinks"><li class="firn-backlink"><a href="/history/history11/index">HIST301 Master Index</a></li></ul></div></main></body></html>
