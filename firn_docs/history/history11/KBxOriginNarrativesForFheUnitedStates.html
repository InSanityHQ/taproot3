Let's get this.</span></span></h2><section><p><span>Historical narratives dictate what is viewed as reality. We look to them
to describe the past reality but also to understand the present one.
However, narratives are inherently not reality. The process of
converting events into a narrative -- narrativization -- is
fundamentally distortive. Narrativized reality is no longer reality.
This process has four major steps: first, the myriad events of reality
are filtered based on a set of values. Second, these filtered events are
interpreted through the set of values. Third, these filtered events are
fitted into a narrative structure, and finally, fourth, this narrative
creates new values in the populace that consumes it. Each of these steps
moves the inputs farther from reality and closer to a narrative. Such is
the narrativization process, fundamentally only able to create
narratives which reflect a value set instead of reality in its entirety.
However, despite that they are not reality, narratives are still quite
valuable. But because narratives are inherently misleading, we must not
operate under a singular narrative.</span></p><p><span>This narrativization process is evident in the historical narrative
generated from the value that America is fundamentally good.
Dunbar-Ortiz gives an relatively egregious example of the distortion
inherent in this process. She describes the inside cover of the
prestigious book </span><em><span>Out of Many: A History of the American People</span></em><span>, where
an image of a "Navajo woman, dressed formally [was] weaving a nearly
finished rug," which held the design of "the Stars and Stripes." After
hearing Dunbar-Ortiz's objections, the authors of the book responded
"but it's a real photograph" (Dunbar-Ortiz, 14). The authors
cherry-picked this unrepresentative event of the rug creation and
twisted it to fit their agenda of American unity and collaboration.
While yes, it is a "real" photograph, it clearly no longer represents
reality due to the narrativization process. Others acknowledge the
atrocities committed in early American history, but argue that "what
makes America most itself isn't four centuries of racist subjugation.
It's 244 years of effort by Americans --- sometimes halting, but often
heroic --- to live up to our greatest ideal" (Ellison - Stephens).
Hughes argues in his article </span><em><span>A Better Anti-Racism</span></em><span> that "the current
system, warts and all, has enabled huge progress for black people in
recent decades," and that many underplay "how much progress we have
already made" (Hughes). This narrative of American history frames
slavery as the norm when America was created, and something that America
fought hard to abolish. It takes the same history, and makes America the
heroes.</span></p><p><span>On the flip-side, narratives can also be generated using the opposite
value -- that America is fundamentally bad. Dunbar-Ortiz points to the
prior origin narrative and directly contradicts it. She claims that
America was not "born of rebellion against oppression" and didn't lead
to "the broadening and deepening of democracy," but instead was "founded
on the ideology of white supremacy" and "crushed and subjugated the
original civilizations in the territories it now rules" (Dunbar-Ortiz,
20-22). Dunbar-Ortiz directly contradicts Hughes, claiming that the
"narrative of progress" itself is a fallacy (Dunbar-Ortiz, 20). Both
Hughes and Dunbar-Ortiz work with the same corpus of events, and come to
radically different and blatantly contradictory narratives. These
contradictions exist because they don't stem from impossible
contradictions in reality but from contradictions with the value set
each narrative was generated with. Each narrative is incomplete, and
invalid when used as a proxy for reality. However, this is no fault of
Dunbar-Ortiz or Hughes, it is simply the inherent nature of narratives.
Heike argues that the creation "of the utopian community" within America
"unambigously [and] utterly failed" (Heike, 159). However, to Stephens
or Hughes, it may seem quite a bit more ambiguous. Heike, like so many
others, falls into the trap of viewing their narrative as reality, thus
making their conclusions "unambiguous" and "utter."</span></p><p><span>Though narratives are inherently distortive and untrue when used as
proxies for reality, from narratives -- even contradicting ones -- we
can still find truth. These two opposite values, summed up as "my
country right or wrong" by Cowie, create narratives which are all
incomplete; from Morgan's description of dismissing the "rise of liberty
and equality" in America as a "mere sham" as an ignoral of the "hard
facts" to the narratives of those dismissing (Cowie 2 et al. Morgan 5).
As is declared in the "my country right" narrative, Americans did fight
long and hard against atrocity, and they did succeed in making progress.
Such is a truth we can learn and acknowledge. However, we can also
acknowledge the atrocities America has committed, and that these
atrocities still haunt us today and need to be dealt with. The American
narrative is just that: a narrative. There is truth in it just as there
is truth in Shakespeare, despite his plays being untrue in the sense
that they are not reality. We must recognize that these narratives,
while appealing to subscribe to, are not reality. Then, we must go one
step further and recognize that despite them not being reality, they
still hold truth.</span></p><p><span>final essay:
