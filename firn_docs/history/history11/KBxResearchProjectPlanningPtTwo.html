cultural impacts, was born of a confluence of competing political
interests.</span></p><p><span>With Sputnik floating amidst the atmosphere, American society was thrown
into crisis. In a period defined by national pride -- especially over
technological superiority -- the Russians being first to space was
catastrophic for American society: "words do not easily convey the
American reaction to the Soviet satellite," writes NASA, "the only
appropriate characterization that begins to capture the mood on 5
October involves the use of the word hysteria." (CITE nasa) Not only was
the nation's pride damaged, but its very identity was thrown into
question. Lyndon B. Johnson, the Senate Majority Leader at the time,
commented that "Now, somehow, in some new way, the sky seemed almost
alien. I also remember the profound shock of realizing that it might be
possible for another nation to achieve technological superiority over
this great country of ours." (CITE find source) Sputnik was equipped
with a radio, sending out what America "believed to be impulse signals
from the Soviet satellite." (CITE
https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/partners/aol/special/sputnik/sput-04.html)
This eerie and alien reminder of failure was not only received by The
National Broadcasting Company, who "broke into their radio and
television programs to enable their audiences to hear the pinging sound
of the 'moon's' signal," but as the Soviets frequently mentioned, by
anyone with a radio. Virtually anyone could -- and did -- hear and track
what otherwise would have been an "invisible emissary." The radio
transformed Sputnik into something "very real and very close," capturing
and frightening "the public's imagination." (CITE
https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/partners/aol/special/sputnik/main.html)
Sputnik had launched, America was in crisis, and the Space Age had
officially begun. The blame had to fall somewhere.</span></p><p><span>Widely accused for letting the Soviet Union overtake the U.S., the
seemingly unfazed President Eisenhower became a target of national
ridicule. Eisenhower was already widely viewed as a "do-nothing [...]
golf and goof" of a president, and Sputnik's launch was no help to his
public perception (CITE
https://digitalcommons.cedarville.edu/channels/vol5/iss1/3/). However,
despite the rest of the nation, Eisenhower seemed unfazed by what became
known as the "Sputnik Crisis" -- "it seemed as though President
Eisenhower," writes Space Age expert Martha Ackmann, "was the only
American who did not initially understand the military, scientific, or
cultural significance of Sputnik's chirp." (CITE
https://www.bookbrowse.com/excerpts/index.cfm/book_number/1249/page_number/3/the-mercury-13).
G. Mennen Williams, the governor of Michigan at the time, characterized
public perception of the Eisenhower administration with a poem: ```Oh
little Sputnik, flying high With made-in-Moscow beep, You tell the world
it's a Commie sky and Uncle Sam's asleep.</span></p><p><span>You say on fairway and on rough The Kremlin knows it all, We hope our
golfer knows enough To get us on the ball. (CITE find) ``` The
Eisenhower administration, with its alarmingly unalarmed supposed
"smiling incompetent" of a spearhead was put under immense pressure.
This pressure, combined with the national panic, led to lasting and
extensive shifts in American society at large.</span></p><p><span>After the initial panic, Sputnik was met with an insurgence of focus on
science and technology in American Society. The importance placed on
science and technology today, especially in education, in large part
resulted from this seemingly "dated and irrelevant" launch of "Sputnik
I, [which] provoked a monumental transformation in the nation's science
policy." (CITE https://www.jstor.org/stable/41821079). At the time,
along with the pressure on President Eisenhower, the consensus became
that "the nation's youth must be taught to appreciate the importance of
science," said the New York Times in 1957. "The United States' way of
life is 'doomed to rapid extinction,' the director of the American
Institute of Physics said yesterday," unless "future generations
appreciate the role of science in modern society." (CITE
https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/partners/aol/special/sputnik/sput-15.html).
Thus, the Eisenhower administration launched NASA, as well as created "a
cornucopia of federal support" for science and technology. The country
was using "science education as a means of security." (CITE
https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2007/10/how-sputnik-changed-u-s-education/).
The culture had shifted, and science and technology became viewed as not
only vital but as the path to prosperity, ushering in a new age of
techno-utopianism. This new cultural ideology was "what it was all
about," says former rocket-scientist Maclen Marvit, born just after the
Sputnik Launch. "Technology was the way to go [...] if you wanted a
better world," he continued. "I now recognize that the historical
context I grew up [in], and much of my personal ideology, is the product
of Sputnik."</span></p><p><span>but it was a lie!</span></p><p><span>what was the lie? there wasnt some big tech gap. america was not really
behind. america already had the tech for the satellite. america knew
sputnik was about to launch sputnik launch was viewed as a good thing</span></p><p><span>Despite the immense impact of the Sputnik launch, the popular narrative
that drove this crisis was woven from lies. In reality, the Sputnik
launch was not a surprise to the Eisenhower Administration, nor did the
supposed Missile Gap exist. The government was able to predict the
launch of Sputnik with high accuracy years before the launch. "We
believe that the USSR will make a major effort to be the first country
to orbit an earth satellite," wrote Assistant Director of Scientific
Intelligence Herbert Scoville Jr.Â in a classified government briefing
released sixty years later. "We further believe it has the capability of
orbiting a small vehicle, in early 1957, which could acquire scientific
information and data of limited military value." (CITE
https://web.archive.org/web/20201104055145/https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/DOC_0006687232.pdf).
Until its recent release, the public was not informed of any of these
predictions, explaining President Eisenhower's unsurprised and thus
unusual demeanor. Furthermore, not only did the government predict
Sputnik's launch, but they had the technology to have beat it.</span></p><p><span>Despite the immense impact of the Sputnik launch, the popular narrative

predictions. However, President Eisenhower knew them well and this
explains his unsurprised (and misinterpreted) demeanor. Furthermore, not
only did the government predict Sputnik's launch, but they had the
technology to have outraced it, and the Soviets, into space. Donald A.
Quarles, the Deputy Secretary of Defense at the time, confessed just
four days after the launch that "there was no doubt that the Redstone,
had it been used, could have orbited a satellite a year or more ago."
(CITE Walter A. McDougall - The Heavens and the Earth_ A Political
History of the Space Age-Johns Hopkins University Press (1997).pdf 134).
But the Eisenhower Administration simply chose not to to use it, or
reveal that they could.</span></p></section></div></div></div></div></article><div class="metapanel"><div class="metalabel">Contents</div><ol><li><a href="#research-project">Research project</a><ol><li><a href="#thoughts">thoughts</a></li><li><a href="#sources">sources</a><ol><li><a href="#"></a></li></ol></li></ol></li></ol><div class="metalabel">Backlinks</div><ul class="firn-backlinks"><li class="firn-backlink"><a href="/history/history11/index">HIST301 Master Index</a></li></ul></div></main></body></html>
