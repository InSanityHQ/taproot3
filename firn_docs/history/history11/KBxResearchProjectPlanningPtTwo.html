cultural impacts, was born of a confluence of competing political
interests.</span></p><p><span>With Sputnik floating amidst the atmosphere, American society was thrown
into crisis. In a period defined by national pride -- especially over
technological superiority -- the Russians being first to space was
catastrophic for American society: "words do not easily convey the
American reaction to the Soviet satellite," writes NASA, "the only
appropriate characterization that begins to capture the mood on 5
October involves the use of the word hysteria." (CITE nasa) Not only was
the nation's pride damaged, but its very identity was thrown into
question. Lyndon B. Johnson, the Senate Majority Leader at the time,
commented that "Now, somehow, in some new way, the sky seemed almost
alien. I also remember the profound shock of realizing that it might be
possible for another nation to achieve technological superiority over
this great country of ours." (CITE find source) Sputnik was equipped
with a radio, sending out what America "believed to be impulse signals
from the Soviet satellite." (CITE
https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/partners/aol/special/sputnik/sput-04.html)
This eerie and alien reminder of failure was not only received by The
National Broadcasting Company, who "broke into their radio and
television programs to enable their audiences to hear the pinging sound
of the 'moon's' signal," but as the Soviets frequently mentioned, by
anyone with a radio. Virtually anyone could -- and did -- hear and track
what otherwise would have been an "invisible emissary." The radio
transformed Sputnik into something "very real and very close," capturing
and frightening "the public's imagination." (CITE
https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/partners/aol/special/sputnik/main.html)
Sputnik had launched, America was in crisis, and the Space Age had
officially begun. The blame had to fall somewhere.</span></p><p><span>Widely accused for letting the Soviet Union overtake the U.S., the
seemingly unfazed President Eisenhower became a target of national
ridicule. Eisenhower was already widely viewed as a "do-nothing [...]
golf and goof" of a president, and Sputnik's launch was no help to his
public perception (CITE
https://digitalcommons.cedarville.edu/channels/vol5/iss1/3/). However,
despite the rest of the nation, Eisenhower seemed unfazed by what became
known as the "Sputnik Crisis" -- "it seemed as though President
Eisenhower," writes Space Age expert Martha Ackmann, "was the only
American who did not initially understand the military, scientific, or
cultural significance of Sputnik's chirp." (CITE
https://www.bookbrowse.com/excerpts/index.cfm/book_number/1249/page_number/3/the-mercury-13).
G. Mennen Williams, the governor of Michigan at the time, characterized
public perception of the Eisenhower administration with a poem: > Oh
little Sputnik, flying high With made-in-Moscow beep, You tell the world
it's a Commie sky and Uncle Sam's asleep. > You say on fairway and on
rough The Kremlin knows it all, We hope our golfer knows enough To get
us on the ball. (CITE find)</span></p><p><span>The Eisenhower administration, with its alarmingly unalarmed supposed
"smiling incompetent" of a spearhead, was put under immense pressure.
This pressure, combined with the national panic, led to lasting and
extensive shifts in American society at large.</span></p><ul><li><p><span>massive focus on stem in schools</span></p></li><li><p><span>qoutes from maclen</span></p></li><li><p><span>tech as the way to success</span></p></li></ul><p><span>After the initial panic, Sputnik was met with an insurgence of focus on
science and technology in American Society. The importance placed on
science and technology today, especially in education, in large part
resulted from this seemingly "dated and irrelevant" launch of "Sputnik
I, [which] provoked a monumental transformation in the nation's science
policy." (CITE https://www.jstor.org/stable/41821079). At the time,
along with the pressure on President Eisenhower, the consensus became
that "the nation's youth must be taught to appreciate the importance of
science," said the New York Times in 1957. "The United States' way of
life is 'doomed to rapid extinction,' the director of the American
Institute of Physics said yesterday," unless "future generations
appreciate the role of science in modern society." (CITE
https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/partners/aol/special/sputnik/sput-15.html).
Thus, the Eisenhower administration launched NASA, as well as created "a
cornucopia of federal support" for science and technology. The country
was using "science education as a means of security."</span></p></section></div></div></div></div></article><div class="metapanel"><div class="metalabel">Contents</div><ol><li><a href="#research-project">Research project</a><ol><li><a href="#thoughts">thoughts</a></li><li><a href="#sources">sources</a></li><li><a href="#qoute-bin">qoute bin</a></li><li><a href="#outlinin!">outlinin!</a><ol><li><a href="#the-cultural-impact-of-sputnik">the cultural impact of sputnik</a></li></ol></li><li><a href="#rougher?">rougher?</a></li></ol></li><li><a href="#f*ck-it-lets-write">f*ck it. lets write.</a></li></ol><div class="metalabel">Backlinks</div><ul class="firn-backlinks"><li class="firn-backlink"><a href="/history/history11/index">HIST301 Master Index</a></li></ul></div></main></body></html>
