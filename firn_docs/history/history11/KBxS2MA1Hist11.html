was fraught with tensions between capitalism and democracy. Democracy
and capitalism's compatibility -- or lack thereof -- is not a simple
binary. Instead, capitalism and democracy are made compatible through
the process of combustion. through the process of combustion, capitalism
and democracy are made compatible.</span></p><p><span>Instead of a simple binary, the relationship between capitalism and
democracy is more aptly illustrated as a set of unstable equilibriums as
shown in the following figure:</span></p><p><span>{FIGURE}</span></p><p><span>These equilibriums reside on two axes: democracy versus autocracy, and
capitalism versus socialism. Each of these axes are also continuums
between two values structures: efficiency and fairness. For example, in
the capitalism-socialism axis, capitalism fundamentally values
efficiency whereas socialism fundamentally values fairness. Thus, in the
four quadrants formed by these two axes, two of them have incompatible
values structures. These quadrants are not sustainable, so societies
within them either veer off into neighboring quadrants or fizzle out.
This behavior is inherent to each axis -- as capitalism increases, the
society will inherently move toward autocracy as wealth and power become
consolidated into the hands of the few, colloquially referred to as
"robber barons" (CITE). As democracy increases, the society will move
toward socialism as the wealthy elite are by definition a minority of
the population. Hence why democratic capitalism forms an unstable
equilibrium, moving any societies which reside in it into neighboring
quadrants. The other quadrant with incompatible value structures is
autocratic socialism, which has been shown to not function numerous
times throughout history, despite the argument that its true form has
never been tried. Thus, societies are funneled into the two quadrants
with compatible value structures: democratic socialism and autocratic
capitalism, valuing fairness and efficiency respectively. As opposed to
how incompatible quadrants push societies away, these quadrants with
shared values structures pull societies into them. These societies sink
further into these quadrants until a balancing force pushes them back
toward the middle. This balancing force is combustion.</span></p><p><span>The rampant combustion throughout the gilded age is</span></p></section><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><><span class="firn-headline-text"></span></><section><p><span>INTRO: Scholars and historians alike have questioned for years whether
democracy and capitalism were combustible or compatible. However, the
relationship between capitalism and democracy is not a simple binary --
the opposite of capitalism isn't democracy but rather socialism, just as
the opposite of democracy is autocracy. Instead, capitalism and
democracy are made compatible through a continual process of social
disruption -- often viewed as "combustion." When capitalism and
democracy, forces that prioritize different values and push society in
opposite directions, are too far out of balance, these disruptions can
be violent. Within America's Gilded Age, society struggled to find a
balance between these opposing forces and the values they embody.
Examples include XXX. When they are more in balance the disruptions are
milder, such as the healthy contention around elections. :: Democracy
and capitalism are made compatible through combustion ::</span></p><p><span>Instead of a simple binary, the contention between different economic
and political systems -- and the values they embrace -- can be
represented with the diagram below.</span></p><p><span>Tensions lie along two axes, with democracy versus autocracy and
capitalism versus socialism representing the extremes. Each of these
axes also represents a continuum between the opposing values of
efficiency and fairness. For example, in the capitalism-socialism axis,
capitalism fundamentally values efficiency whereas socialism
fundamentally values fairness.</span></p><p><span>Thus, in the four quadrants formed by these two axes, two of them have
incompatible values structures. These quadrants are not sustainable, so
societies within them either veer off into neighboring quadrants or
fizzle out. This behavior is inherent to each axis -- as capitalism
increases, the society will inherently move toward autocracy as wealth
and power become consolidated into the hands of the few, colloquially
referred to as "robber barons" (CITE). As democracy increases, the
society will move toward socialism as the wealthy elite are by
definition a minority of the population. Democratic capitalism lies at
an unstable equilibrium, moving any societies which reside in it into
neighboring quadrants. The other quadrant with incompatible value
structures is autocratic socialism, which has been shown to not function
numerous times throughout history across a variety of failed communist
societies. Thus, societies are funneled into the two quadrants with
compatible value structures: democratic socialism and autocratic
capitalism, valuing fairness and efficiency respectively. As opposed to
how incompatible quadrants push societies away, these quadrants with
shared values structures pull societies into them. These societies sink
further into these quadrants until a balancing force pushes them back
toward the middle. This balancing force is combustion.</span></p><p><span>The Industrial Revolution is an example of this balancing through
combustion, moving society toward autocratic capitalism with efficiency
as the driving value. Taking place between the mid seventeen and
eighteen-hundreds, America "endured a phase of madcap expansion" during
the Industrial Revolution (Klein & Kantor, 2). These massive changes --
combustion -- swept the nation, overhauling both infrastructure and
ideals. Instead of fairness, society was now chiefly concerned with a
"quest for greater productivity, for more efficient machines, [and] more
output per unit of cost" (Trachtenberg & Fink, 9). And this quest was
successful, as by 1900, "the United States was the world's leading
manufacturing nation" (YAWP). However, as America slid toward efficiency
along the axis of capitalism, America was met with the accompanying
slide toward autocracy. Taylorism created an insurmountable divide
between the "workers as interchangeable as the parts they were using"
and those who owned the means of production (YAWP). Thus, the rich got
richer, and the poor stayed poor with virtually no hope of escape. This
inequality became so extreme that by 1900, "the richest 10 percent
controlled perhaps 90 percent of the nation's wealth" (YAWP). These
elite had much more power over society than the average laborer, and
were only becoming more powerful. Yes, society was efficient, but it
wasn't fair -- America had truly slid into the autocratic-capitalism
upper quadrant, and it was time for another combustion.</span></p><p><span>Society combusted once again to form a balancing response to the
Industrial Revolution and its consequences. Inequality had become too
extreme, and working conditions had become too poor. Society began to
shift towards valuing fairness once again: "Wall Street owns the
country," declared the popular People's Party participant Mary Elizabeth
Lease in 1890. "It is no longer a government of the people... but a
government of Wall Street" (YAWP). Sold on the need for reform, workers
banded together, trying to utilize their strength in numbers to create
change. They formed unions such as the Knights of Labor and the AFL,
going on strikes in the hundreds of thousands. Events like the Triangle
Shirtwaist Factory fire convinced American society at large "of the need
for reform" (YAWP). Socialism was gaining prominence, democracy was
being restored, and society was combusting; the Progressive Era had been
born.</span></p></section></div></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="hist-ma1-reflection!"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>hist ma1 reflection!</span></span></h2><section><p><strong><span>PFDPSE</span></strong></p><p><span>I spent a long time thinking about this essay, as I felt like their was
