\section{And the great experiment begins..}
\label{sec:orge5f0535}
\begin{itemize}
\item tracing liberty, democracy and ext chellenged by tracing opression,
exploitation, and racism

\begin{itemize}
\item which is good, cus it makes us examine the role of slavery more
directly?
\end{itemize}

\item argues, slavery is more than an exception
\item cant dismiss liberty and equality either!
\item both developments, liberty \& equality and slavery were going on at the
same time
\item \textbf{this was the paradox}

\begin{itemize}
\item how could this happen? big question for colonial historian
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
free ships make free goods
\end{verbatim}

\begin{itemize}
\item cardinal doctrine

\begin{itemize}
\item goods were produced by slave labor
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
"americans bought their indepenndence with slave labor"
\end{verbatim}

\begin{itemize}
\item racism, liberty only applies to light skinned people, but doesn't
fully account for the paradox?
\item "the man who depended on another for his living could never be truly
free"
\item jefferson

\begin{itemize}
\item hated debt

\begin{itemize}
\item becuase it limiteed his freedom of action
\item he could not free his slaves as long as he was in debt
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
his animosity towards hamilton was because of hamiltons pro-British foreign policy, which would tighten the hold of british creditors 
and his domestic policy, which would place the government in the debt of native american creditors 
\end{verbatim}
\end{itemize}

\item jeffery, jeffery ison

\begin{itemize}
\item almost obsessive about debt
\item country of debtors was ripe for tyranny
\item the citizens of a republic must be free from the control of other
men and that they could be free only if they were econollically free

\begin{itemize}
\item by virtue of owning land on which to support themselves
\end{itemize}

\item didn't like artificers!
\end{itemize}

\item people belived that people in the dregs of society arrived at that
position through their own vice and misconduct
\item andrew fletcher

\begin{itemize}
\item big libery guy, also big slave guy
\item didnt like the church for setting up hospitals cus it permitted the
non working man to live
\item all the non-working men were proposed to be maid into to slaves to
men of property
\item argues that it is in the masters best intrest to treat slaves well,
unless slaves are behaving poorly

\begin{itemize}
\item jesus\ldots{}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
but [jefferson] did share fletcher's distrust of men who were free in the name while their empty bellies made them thieves
\end{verbatim}

\begin{itemize}
\item made them slaves to anybody who would feem them?

\item jefferson did not want the "idle poor" to be reduced to slavery

\item problem: freeing slaves -> half a mil "idle poor"

\begin{itemize}
\item the idea: slaves were acustomed to compulsory labor and would not
work withough it
\end{itemize}

\item jefferson wanted to teach his slaves as part of his plan for freeing
them

\item cimarrons and stuff,

\begin{itemize}
\item they didn't like the spanish, teamed with peopled
\item robbed em
\end{itemize}

\item virginia made englishmen out of all kinds of people?

\begin{itemize}
\item natives had all the rights of others

\begin{itemize}
\item slave or not?
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\item virginia actully killed alot of the people when went there

\begin{itemize}
\item via disease
\end{itemize}

\item market was not going well

\item virginia kept inheriting immigrants

\item described as "a sinke to drayen England of her filth and scum"

\item rebelion happened!

\item virginia inhereted englands social problem

\begin{itemize}
\item solution: restrict liberties of those who did not have the proper
badge of freedom
\end{itemize}

\item then, laws set in place to allow people to keep their servants for as
long as possible

\item 1670, voting was limited to landholers and housholders

\item solution put an end to the process of turning natives into englishmen?

\begin{itemize}
\item the rights of the enlglismen were preserved buy destroing the rights
of the africans
\end{itemize}

\item slavery "came" to virginia unthinkingly

\begin{itemize}
\item people just bought the cheapest option
\item laws were passed to discriminate
\item 
\end{itemize}

\item argues that all the good came out of slavery
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
thus began the american paradox of slavery and freedon, intertwined and interdependent, right rights of englishmen supported on the wrongs of Africans. 
\end{verbatim}

\#review the end\ldots{} unclear on it
