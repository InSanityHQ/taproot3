scientific process. It provides solutions for fighting bias and error
with a four step method, mostly based around hypothesis creation. While
this can in fact reduce human intervention getting in the way of
progress, I wonder if we can truly get to a point where human error is
eliminated. If we can't, what does this mean about the nature of
science? Is this like Godel's theory but with the real world? (I know
that's a stretch)</span></p></section></div></div></div></article><div class="metapanel"><div class="metalabel">Contents</div><ol><li><a href="#strong-inference">Strong Inference</a><ol><li><a href="#&gt;-scientists-these-days-tend-to-keep-up-a-polite-fiction-that-all">> Scientists these days tend to keep up a polite fiction that all</a></li><li><a href="#the-reason-why-some-fields-are-better-than-others,-supposedly">The reason why some fields are better than others, supposedly.</a></li></ol></li><li><a href="#\[discussion\-point:\]">\[Discussion\ point:\]</a></li></ol><div class="metalabel">Backlinks</div><ul class="firn-backlinks"><li class="firn-backlink"><a href="/isos/intro_to_isos/KBISOSMasterIndex">ISOS Master Index</a></li></ul></div></main></body></html>
