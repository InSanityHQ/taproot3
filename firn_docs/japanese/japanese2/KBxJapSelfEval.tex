\begin{verbatim}
Please reflect on your learning this past semester in the following areas.  Write a few sentences for each question (#1-3).  You donâ€™t have to answer all the sub-questions; they are just suggestions.  Please answer in English.
\end{verbatim}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Highlights
\end{enumerate}

One highlight was the oral exam --- not the exam itself, but the process
of studying for the exam. While incredibly stressful and a massive
amount of work, it felt good to finally be able to put everything we
have learned this semester to use.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Challenges
\end{enumerate}

Some of the early listening quizzes were quite challenging for me, as
the audio was not nearly as clear as in person. I was also just getting
used to the whole quarantine schooling situation, which is much
different than last year.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Goals
\end{enumerate}

My goals were to try to become more 'fluent,' in the sense that the
barrier between meaning and sentence in Japanese is reduced. I
definitely do feel that I have reduced this barrier quite a bit. In the
next semester, I seek to continue to reduce this barrier.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Do you have any other questions, comments, or requests for me?
\end{enumerate}

Despite the constant barrage of apocalypses (apocali?), it has been a
wonderful semester of Japanese!
