generating data as compiling the data used to solved a problem, as
opposed to say creating a dataset or simulating a programmatic model
based on a problem. Before I start a non-trivial problem, I always
compile the data that I've collected that could be helpful in solving
the problem. This data is generally in the form of my notes or previous
endeavors. Once I'm done, I put what I've what learned back into my note
system for later use. I tag parts of these notes #question when I don't
understand, want to explore further, or have a tangential question. I
then go back into my notes and answer these questions.</span></p><p><strong><span>Generalize and Test</span></strong><span> Proficient Looking for patterns and connections is
the way I organize my learning. For example, here's a graph of my own
personal wiki-style Linear Algebra notes! [[file:Pasted image
20211009143418.png|300.org][Pasted image 20211009143418.png|300]] Each
vertex is a note, and each edge is generated when I link two concepts
together from my notes. Each of these connections has justification, or
rather, explanation which I write for myself. However, these
justification are rarely formal because they are just meant for me. I
generally write out the reasoning that I need to make the connection
intuitive, then give an example of how the connection works. I don't
write up formal proofs for each connection. To summarize, I look for and
identify patterns and processes, I describe them, test them, I do not
justify them formally and fully, and I do look for patterns between
different concepts.</span></p><p><strong><span>Abstract and Symbolize</span></strong><span> Proficient Other than early on with some of the
set theory notation, I don't have trouble understanding the formal
notation or definitions in class and in the readings. As for my written
assignments, I use formal notation generated with markdown-embedded
\(\LaTeX\).</span></p><p><span>However, for my notes, I am simply not fast enough to use formal
notation and definitions. Thus, my definitions end up with a lot of
abbreviated words, any my notation often doesn't include things like
\(v \in V\) when all the elements discussed are in V. In my notes, I
also use notation that makes sense to me instead of being formal, like
arrows and != instead of \(\neq\) . These notations are powerful, though
not formal.</span></p><p><strong><span>Transform</span></strong><span> Exemplary So far, we haven't had a lot of chances to create
computational representations in this class. In my Mathematical Modeling
class, however, we have. I don't know if this counts, but for almost
every project I create multiple representations -- for the most recent
problem, I created 3 different models in Blender each using a different
technique, a 3D printed model, a mathematical representation, and also a
computational representation which I viewed with the 3D plotter in
Matplotlib after algorithmically generating the data. Each of these
models of course served their own purpose and were compared to the
others.</span></p><p><strong><span>Strategy</span></strong><span> Proficient Frankly, having an rote problem solving process
simply doesn't work in Linear Algebra. The only way I can solve the
problems is through similar techniques to when I'm doing competitive
programming, like writing out incremental 'lemmas,' trying to segment
the problem, and thinking though the problem conceptually before going
into the nitty-gritty. I do not, however, often solve a problem multiple
ways then go back and compare each of the techniques I used to solve the
problem when doing the homework or in class problems.</span></p><p><strong><span>Proof</span></strong><span> Proficient One of the hardest parts for me so far in Linear
Algebra is converting my understanding into formal proofs. My proofs
have formal structure, and the arguments are mostly complete, but
sometimes I have gaps simply due to the finer granularity of proof-logic
as opposed to understanding-logic. I can and do analyze the approaches
of others, often when they ask for help in the Linear Algebra Discord
server. I can often help, but this is more due to just being a fresh
pair of eyes or a good rubber ducky.</span></p><p><strong><span>Application</span></strong><span> Foundational? I have not yet solved an exercise or a proof
then went and looked for real world applications for my solution. I have
often, however, been in the real world and needed a solution, and
employed linear algebra to get it. In fact, I did this just yesterday
for a ML project, figuring out what my matrix would need to look like
after doing some operation to my bits. My process goes: real world ->
math -> solution, not math -> solution -> real world. I don't know where
this puts me.</span></p><p><strong><span>Clarity and Articulation</span></strong><span> Exemplary When being shown to other students,
I try to make my work clear. In my first proof presentation, I spent the
first half of it going over the problem and then laying out the
conceptual basis of the solution. The second half then converted this
conceptual basis into rigorous mathematical notation.</span></p><p><strong><span>Precision and Accuracy</span></strong><span> Proficient Sometimes I mess up with the finer
details, or I confuse a definition with something equivalent. These
types of errors haven't been problems in previous math classes, but as
I'm learning, is a problem in Linear Algebra. I'm starting to be more
careful with my definitions and look for errors in my work that I'm not
used to looking for (like missing an iff! Still sad about that one).
However, this is all about tailoring how I check my work when doing
linear algebra. In the more general case, after finding a potential
solution to a problem, I always pass it through a reality check or try
to link it to something else and see if it makes sense.</span></p><p><strong><span>Growth Mindset</span></strong><span> Exemplary I'm taking Linear Algebra because I want to
learn about Linear Algebra. I pick my classes and do my work based on
what I'm excited about, not based on my grades or how hard they are. I
hope this strategy is evident in the types of questions I ask in class.</span></p><p><span>I know this Growth Mindset focused strategy is risky, but so far its
worked out!</span></p><p><strong><span>Community</span></strong><span> Exemplary Doing math with friends is a lot of fun. It's also
vital to solving some of the harder problems. Because of this, I started
and maintain the Linear Algebra Discord server.</span></p><p><strong><span>Reflection</span></strong><span> Proficient? I don't turn in reflections to my normal
assignments. However, for my notes both in class and for the readings /
exercises, I do a lot of reflecting. This reflection generally happens
in two forms:</span></p><p><span>or in what I call "Gardening." Gardening is the cultivation of my
digital garden (cheesy, I know), where I segment my notes into
conceptual chunks then link them all together and find connections /
patterns.</span></p><p><strong><span>Academic Habits</span></strong><span> Exemplary My habits are based around my interests. I'm
excited about this stuff! Linear Algebra is super fun. In class, almost
always the most interesting thing to be doing is engaging in the class.
I say almost always because sometimes other things take priority, like
running to the nurse. Sometimes, admittedly, I am too tired to trust my
questions in class -- when this happens, I shift my notes to a finer
granularity, and spend more time Gardening. To the best of my memory, I
turn in my work on time consistently.</span></p></section><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="summary"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Summary</span></span></h3><section><table><tr><td></td><td><span>Foundational</span></td><td><span>Proficient</span></td><td><span>Exemplary</span></td></tr><tr></tr><tr><td><span>Explore and Organize</span></td><td><span>x?</span></td><td></td><td><span>x?</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>Generalize and Test</span></td><td></td><td><span>x</span></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><span>Abstract and Symbolize</span></td><td></td><td><span>x</span></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><span>Transform</span></td><td></td><td></td><td><span>x</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>Strategy</span></td><td></td><td><span>x</span></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><span>Proof</span></td><td></td><td><span>x</span></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><span>Application</span></td><td><span>x?</span></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><span>Clarity and Articulation</span></td><td></td><td></td><td><span>x</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>Precision and Accuracy</span></td><td></td><td><span>x</span></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><span>Growth Mindset</span></td><td></td><td></td><td><span>x</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>Community</span></td><td></td><td></td><td><span>x</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>Reflection</span></td><td></td><td><span>x?</span></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><span>Academic Habits</span></td><td></td><td></td><td><span>x</span></td></tr></table></section></div></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="quiz-corrections"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Quiz Corrections</span></span></h2><section><p><span>Attached in another file.</span></p><p><a class="firn-internal" href="/mathematics/linear_algebra/quiz_corrections.pdf">quiz_corrections.pdf</a></p></section></div></div></div></article><div class="metapanel"><div class="metalabel">Contents</div><ol><li><a href="#skills-and-practices">Skills and Practices</a><ol><li><a href="#summary">Summary</a></li></ol></li><li><a href="#quiz-corrections">Quiz Corrections</a></li></ol><div class="metalabel">Backlinks</div><ul class="firn-backlinks"><li class="firn-backlink"><a href="/mathematics/linear_algebra/index">Linear Algebra Master Index</a></li></ul></div></main></body></html>
