decreases exponentially. This behavior makes sense, as when the magnet
is closest to the coil is there the most changing magnetic flux, thus
inducing the most current. \[|EMF| = |\frac{d \phi}{dt}|\] As the magnet
passes the coils midpoint, the direction of the induced current would be
expected to flip yet still be at its strongest point. This expected
behavior is also what is measured.</span></p><hr /><p><span>first experiment</span></p><p><span>clockwise current is positive</span></p><p><span>counterclockwise induced current</span></p><p><span>yello wwirte goes to positive current drop magnet through coil induces

roughly 5cm long with a magnetic field sensor roughly halfway inside of
it. Positive current is being run through the wire at roughly 0.45A. The
loose coil, or solenoid, consists of 14 loops.</span></p><p><span>When a current is run through the wire, a magnetic field is induced
inside of the coil. This magnetic field is expected to follow the
equation \[B=\mu n I\] where \[B\] is our magnetic field inside our
coil, \[\mu\] is roughly equal to \[4 \pi \cdot 10^{-7} Tm / A\], \[n\]
is the number of wraps per unit unit length, and \[I\] is our current.
This equation can also be represented as \[B=\mu \frac{n I}{l}\] where
\[l\] is the length of our solenoid.</span></p><p><span>Thus, our expected magnetic field output would be
\[B = \frac{ 4 \pi \cdot 10^{-7} \cdot 0.45 \cdot 14 } {0.05} = 0.158 \textrm{ mT (milliteslas)}\]</span></p><p><span>Our baseline magnetic field value measured by our sensor is 0.035mT,
while our measured magnetic field value is -0.10mT. Thus, the difference
in measured magnetic field is 0.135mT.</span></p><p><span>Calculating the percent error between our two values with
\[\delta = \left| \frac{v_A - v_E}{v_E} \right| \cdot 100\%\] yields
14.55% error. Given potential sources of error within our experiment,
14.55% error is entirely reasonable to verify our theoretical equation.
Some of these potential sources of error include the sensors being off,
external magnetic fields changing, human precision limit in reading the
values measured, and a slightly misplaced magnetic field sensor.</span></p></section></div></div></div></div></article><div class="metapanel"><div class="metalabel">Contents</div><ol><li><a href="#lab-report">Lab Report</a><ol><li><a href="#experiment-1">Experiment 1</a></li><li><a href="#experiment-2">Experiment 2</a></li></ol></li></ol><div class="metalabel">Backlinks</div><ul class="firn-backlinks"><li class="firn-backlink"><a href="/physics/modern_physics/index">Physics Master Index</a></li></ul></div></main></body></html>
