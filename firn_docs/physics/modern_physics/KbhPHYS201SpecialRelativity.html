like the motion w.r.t. any frame is governed by the same law. i.e.Â if

different. So...</span></p><p><a class="firn-internal" href="/physics/modern_physics/Pasted image 20210208105746.png">Pasted image

only be affected by the direction of lght travel, not perpandicular to
it.*</span></p><p><a class="firn-internal" href="/physics/modern_physics/Pasted image 20210210094431.png">Pasted image

\(\frac{\delta t}{2} \times V\) (speed of prime travel times half the
distance between A and B).</span></p><p><span>And lastly, to figure out how much light travels, it is simply the
hipotenuse between L and \(\frac{\delta t}{2} \times V\).</span></p><p><a class="firn-internal" href="/physics/modern_physics/Pasted image 20210210094759.png">Pasted image
20210210094759.png</a></p><p><span>Notice! With this roundabout way, we have an equation with \(\delta t\)
on both sides: becaues we could figure out the distance of light travel
to mirror, doubling that divided by speed of light will result in
\(\delta t\) again!</span></p><p><span>Doing some algebra to seperate the \(\delta t\), we shall get that:</span></p><p><a class="firn-internal" href="/physics/modern_physics/Pasted image 20210210095050.png">Pasted image

20210210095115.png</a></p><p><span>Why is \(2L/c = \delta t'\)? Think! look at the primed (moving) frame.
W.r.t. the moving object, the light is traveling exactly perpendicular
up and down. So, the change in time in that case is just twice the
vertical distance divided by the speed of light.</span></p><p><span>Physicsts tend to define a \(\gamma\) and write the same equation as
follows:</span></p><p><a class="firn-internal" href="/physics/modern_physics/Pasted image 20210210095218.png">Pasted image
20210210095218.png</a></p><p><span>Now.... Notice! If \(v\) is small, \(\gamma=1\) and hence
\(\delta t = \delta t'\)</span></p><p><span>As \(v \to c\), \(\gamma\) increases and hence, to M, M' will be
traveling quickly foward to time</span></p><p><a class="firn-internal" href="/physics/modern_physics/Pasted image 20210210100247.png">Pasted image
20210210100247.png</a></p><p><span>So. Knowledges: \(\gamma(v) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-(v^2/c^2)**2}}\). which
means, for speeds at %c, \(\gamma(pc) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-pc^2}}\). And
finally, for stationary observer \(x\) and moving observer \(x'\),
\(\delta t = \delta t' \gamma\).</span></p><p><span>What's even cooler? this principle applies to the length of the moving
frame as well --- but backwards. That, at a moving frame,
\(D' = D \gamma\), where \(D\) is size of the moving frame ("length of
the spaceship") when it is not moving to the non-moving frame, and
\(D'\) the size of the moving frame when it is moving to the non-moving
frame.</span></p><p><span>Of course, beware of thinking this as the "length of the ship", though.
For instance, if your stationary frame is the spaceship, the "length of
the spaceship" would then be the distance between the planets.</span></p><p><span>Remember: two objects will need to be parallel to each other and one
traveling in a linear motion while the other stationary for this to
work!</span></p><p><strong><span>Displacement equales velocity multiplied by the time interval</span></strong><span> (and
