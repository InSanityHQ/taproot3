#+title: Elastic Collision
#+author: Houjun Liu

We are given that the object $m_1$ collides with the rod with velocity $v_0$, and the rod is floating in free space. Given $m_1$, $v_0$, $m_2$, $I_0$, and $r$, we are to figure to the final velocity of $m_1$ after collision $v_f$, the velocity of $m_2$ after collision $v_{CM}$, and of course the rotation of the rod after collision $\omega$.

We are assuming that this collision elastic.

We have, then, for conservation of linear momentum:

\begin{equation}
 m_1 v_0 = m_1v_f + m_2 v_{CM} 
\end{equation}

Furthermore, we understand that angular momentum is also conserved here; therefore:

\begin{equation}
0 = I_0\omega 
\end{equation}

as the point mass does not have any rotational inertia, and the rod is not rotating at the start
