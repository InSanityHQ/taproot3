One of the ideals which I tried to be better at this summer was on the area of explain-ability. As we discussed more in the last evaluation, it is useful for the class for me to be able to pause and evaluate the big picture of problems; as such, I hope to take into account the pacing for which I am doing tasks and enabling others to be able to learn alongside me.

Of course, this year also represents an improvement upon my note taking and demonstration system. Instead of writing one set of equation and algebraic derivations, I endeavor to dictate the steps I am taking as a part of helping myself in the future and others come back and understand my work.

One of the things that I want to expand on more is how best to share this with others, while increasing my own accumulation of knowledge. At it stands, if I am creating a screencast or writing a problem set, I have to make sure that I personally understand the result first---writing scratch work, notes on paper, etc.---and then performing the "demonstrative" portion of the task to be able to propagate the knowledge to others.

Perhaps this is one of the signs of mastery: that as I get better at the material I would be able to actually parallel-process the solving of it and the explaining of it. For instance, it would be trivially obvious to write some basic Python code and explain it at the same time; however, I cannot yet achieve the same for taking, for instance, high-dimensional integral.

In this class, I believe I have become more fluid in this way: being able to, although not fully, attempt to parallel-process conceptual and real understanding more fluidly. I am hopeful that, though more work in physics (where MVC knowledge is very applicable), and ML, I should be able to achieve this skill and intuition for MVC.

Thank you again for a great year! Hope to work with you in the future.
