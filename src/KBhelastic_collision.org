* Elastic collision
We are given that the object $m_1$ collides with the rod with velocity $v_0$, and the rod is floating in free space. Given $m_1$, $v_0$, $m_2$, $I_0$, and $r$, we are to figure to the final velocity of $m_1$ after collision $v_f$, the velocity of $m_2$ after collision $v_{CM}$, and of course the rotation of the rod after collision $\omega$.

We are assuming that this collision elastic.

We have, then, for conservation of linear momentum:

\begin{equation}
 m_1 v_0 = m_1v_f + m_2 v_{CM} 
\end{equation}

Furthermore, we understand that kinetic energy is also conserved here; therefore:

\begin{align}
&\frac{1}{2} m_1{v_0}^2 + \frac{1}{2} m_1 {v_0}^2 = \left(\frac{1}{2} m_1{v_f}^2\right)+\left(\frac{1}{2} m_1{v_f}^2\right)+\left(\frac{1}{2} m_2{v_{CM}}^2\right)+\left(\frac{1}{2} I_0{\omega}^2\right)\\
\Rightarrow & 2m_1{v_0}^2 = \left( 2m_1{v_f}^2\right)+\left( m_2{v_{CM}}^2\right)+\left( I_0{\omega}^2\right)
\end{align}

as the point mass does not have any rotational inertia, and the rod is not rotating at the start.

Lastly, we understand that the angular momentum is conserved through a collision; letting the origin as the center of mass of the rod:

\begin{align}
   &m_1 r^2 \left(\frac{v_0}{r}\right) = m_1 r^2 \left(\frac{v_f}{r}\right) + I_0 \omega\\
\Rightarrow &m_1 r v_0 = m_1 r v_f + I_0 \omega
\end{align}

We now have a system of three equations that can be combined to solve for three unknowns $v_f$, $v_{CM}$, and $\omega$.

Performing the actual solution digitally:

\begin{equation}
   v_{cm} = \frac{4I_0m_1v_0}{m_1m_2r^2+I_0m_1+2I_0m_2} 
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
   v_f = \frac{(m_1m_2r^2 + I_0m_1 - 2I_0m_2)v_0}{m_1m_2r^2 + I_0m_1+2I_0m_2} 
\end{equation}

and finally, we have

\begin{equation}
   \omega = \frac{4m_1m_2rv_0}{m_1m_2r^2+I_0m_1+2Im_2} 
\end{equation}
