# Bio informatics!
*guinea pig time*

## bio overview
about genomic information transfer
and also, viruses! 

recall: exons, introns, coding regions, non-coding regions, all that good stuff 
it's hard to find these exons and introns! not obvious
also the concept of `consensus sequence`

real world gene time! ::
11k base pairs for a single gene in what is considered a simply organism
worm genes are defined as `##-L`
good test cases, as well documented! poor c elegans tho.. (but who cares, they are worms.)

c elegans advantage:
- dvides quickly 
- has a development map (knows where each section leads to in the development)
- and also, available? i mean, they're worms man

## some ideas
- ml to identify certain aspects of base pair sequences? exrons/introns, etc
	→ different protein versions from one gene, called transcripts. this is done with diff combinations of exrons
		- the ones that appear are experimentally verified

- semantic similarity graph? some time of fdg?
	- context-dependant similarty?
- some type of word vectors? genomic embedding space

- compression??
	- 
- predict *folding/function* similarity with sequence?









F → E

(E_1 vs. E_2) → "true" similarity
→ model (L_1, L_2) → predict "true" similarity → similarity metric 

metric vs. edit distance 

"true" vs. nlp metrics
