* What are kinetics:
- how fast a reaction proceeds

* Why care?
- Real world application: if you want to make a chemical (say some sort of medicine), then you will want to make it faster so you can keep with the demand of the product.
- Kinetics is the study of the speed of reactions, so you can apply it to speeding the production of your medicine

* Basis of kinetics:
- collision theory

* Collision theory:
- particles must collide before a reaction can take place
- not all collisions lead to a reaction
- reactants must posses at least a minimun amount of energy - *Activation energy*
- *Steric effect* : particles must approach each other in a certain way

* Qualitative side to kinetics:
** according to collision theory, for a faster recation, you want:
*** more frequent collisions
- more speed
- more particles
*** more successful collisions
- more energy
- lower activation energy
**  what this looks like
*** increase the surface area
- this way more particles are exposed
- powdered solids react faster than larger lumps
*** increase the temperature
- more kinetic energy to your particles
- this increases the speed of your particles
- this increases frequency of collisions
- the extrac kinetic energy also allows the particles to get over the activation energy thershold
  - Boltzman distribution
*** shine light
- same as temperature, just a different source of energy
*** add a catalyst
- when added, catalysts provide an alternative reaction path with a lower activation energy (change the mechanism of the reaction)
- decreasing the activation energy means that more particles will have sufficient energy to overcome the energy barrier and react
- beacuse they reduce the activation energy in the forward direction, the also reduce the activation energy in the reverse direction, see diagram below
- the catalyst remains chemically unchanged at the end of the reaction.

*** increase the pressure of gases
- when you increase the pressure of the vessel you are essentially decreasing the volume of the vessel
- this means your molecules are going to interact with each other more often
- this will increase the frequency of collisions
*** increase the concentration of reactants
- you can also increase the amount of the reactants, this leaves a higher chance of collision which will lead to more collisions and thus a faster reaction

* Quantitative side to kinetics:
** rate of a reaction:

- the reaction starts off fast and then asymptotically gets slower
- this is because as time goes on there will be less and less reactant particals to collide with and keep the reaction going.
- the rate of the reaction would be the derivative of the C curve
- the *initial rate* of a reaction is the slope af the very begining of the curve
** The initial reaction rate equation:
- $r=k[A]^x[B]^y$, where:
  - k is a constant, depends on the reaction
  - [A] is the concentration of A
  - [B] is the concentration of B
  - x is an exponent that change based on the reaction 
  - y is an exponent that changes based on the reaction
- unit of the rate of an equation: mol/dm^3/s
** Order of a reaction:
- $x+y$, where x and y are what was from the rate equation

* Given the graph of concentration (of one chemical) vs time:
- you can look at the shape to get the order of the concentration
- if you have a line (linear) that points downward then you have an order of 0
- if you have a curve, that curves downward you have an order of 1
- if you have a half of a parabola that points upward, then you have an order of 2

* Arrhenius Equation:
- $k=Ae^{-\frac{E_a}{RT}}$
  - Where k is the rate constant
  - A is pre-expoential factor (frequency collision factor)
  - e is the constant
  - E_a is activation energy
  - R is a constant, 8.31 J/(K*mol)
  - T is temperature (in kelvin)
