$\text{molar mass}(CaSO_{4})= 136.12$

$$\text{moles} = \frac{\text{mass}}{\text{molar mass}}$$

> Why is it essential to use balanced chemical equations in solving stoichiometry problems?

Otherwise your operations are not mathematically valid due to conservation of mass.

> The fermentation of glucose, $C_6H_12O_6$, produces ethyl alcohol, $C_2H_5OH$, and $CO_2$ as shown here:
> $C_6H_12O_6 (aq) \to 2 C_2H_5OH(aq) + 2 CO_2 (g)$

> 2.a How many moles of $CO_2$ are produced when 0.300 mol of $C_6H_12O_6$ reacts in this fashion?

1 mol of $C_{6}H_{12}O_{6}$ produces 2 mol of $CO_2$
0.3 mol of $C_{6}H_{12}O_{6}$ produces 0.6 mol of $CO_2$

>2.b How many grams of $C_6H_12O_6$ are needed to form 2.00 g of $C_2H_5OH$?

The molar mass of $C_2H_5OH$ is $46 \frac{g}{mol}$. Thus, $2g \cdot \frac{mol}{48g} = \frac{1}{23} \text{mol } C_2H_5OH$. The molar mass of $C_6H_12O_{6}= 180 \frac{g}{mol}$, which means that $\frac{1}{46} \text{mol } \cdot 180 \frac{g}{mol }  C_6H_12O_{6} \sim 3.913g \text{ }C_6H_12O_{6}$

> 3 Aluminum sulfide reacts with water to form aluminum hydroxide and hydrogen sulfide.

Aluminum Sulfide: $AL_2S_3$
Aluminum Hydroxide: $Al(OH)_3$
Hydrogen Sulfide:  $H_2S$

$AL_2S_{3} + H_{2}O \to Al(OH)_{3}+ H_2S$

> 3.a Write the balanced chemical equation for this reaction.
