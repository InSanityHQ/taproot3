# systems of systems? of systems? damn.

identify with the math as you identify with characters

we are a system! we can think about different levels of abstraction
and some work better than others? #question what does that mean?

> "math story"

oh hey, we get to learn some category theory!


one works at exploratorium, and one works at https://topos.institute

## category theory

### contextualizing category theory:

- group theory talks about symmetry, 
	- construct a language which can identify symmetry agnostic to the implimentation
		- this is about **finding the right abstraction**
	- characterize by operations that land in the same place (ie, flip, rotate, ect.) <- the abstraction! it's here.
		- this means we can get the concept of "triangular symmetry" when things are isometric with themselves in the same way a triangle is
	- adding actions in seqence means we can get algebra, as one operation composed with another can be equal to a third
	- every two actions in seqence can be represented by one
		- so we can get a multiplication table, in a sense
		- that table, is a **group**!
			- there is one of these for every group
			
- had to go covid test, missed topology overview
	- but essentially, when making languages for each set, we can communicate between them
		- but we need a higher level abstraction!
		- yes. yes we can, with a ... directed graph!

### directed graphs as meta-abstraction

for topology, an arrow represents a map between two objects. ofc, there are essentially inf possible maps
- a map is a continuous map where topology is preserved when mapping specific points between two objects
	- the "verbs" are the maps
- between any two nodes, there is a bundle of maps going to and from every node
	- + reflective loops, maps to themselves
- instead, we represent a bundle in a direction as a single arrow
- making this directed graph for every possible topology is a **category**

we can do the same for linear algebra, 

abstraction scheme:
find uniform representation -> get ideas
category theory is this, but one layer of abstraction higher

"category theory is the mathematics of mathematics" 

- logic can also fit into category theory, 
- and also programming,
- and even categories can form a category!
	- fit across multiple layers of abstraction, called doing "yoga"

### what it feels like to do category theory

- alexander grothendieck: big name
	- went crazy, turned into a monk guy, and drank dandelion soup a lot
- argued, 
- proving a theorem like cracking a nut
	- hammer and chisel style, (elegance)
- but instead you need
	- dropping the nut into water, and having it slowly soften over the course of months

category theory solves interopabilty problems

**birds eye view of mathematics**
- details become invisible, but you can spot patterns that would otherwise be impossible to spot. 
	- emergent property!!

## accounting systems

?what rules are their for pointing?

math is just an accounting system.
about, what has to stay the same, and what can get disrupted (ie. algebra, preserve the equality but disrupt the sides)

mathematical move of "what am i made out of / what makes things work together question mark?"


when you find the right abstractions that contain two things, you get a lot more

think, distance and cheese both lead to numbers

### interface
humans be represented as an interface, with inputs and outputs
mike levin, neuroscientist. check em out!

life organizises themselves

life, is what counters entropy? they organize themselves **more**
```ad-important
this is crazy cool!!!
```

do your own thing, not someone elses thing.
