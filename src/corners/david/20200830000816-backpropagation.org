#+TITLE: Backpropagation

Backpropagation is the method through which a normal neural network trains and minimizes loss. The goal of backpropagation is compute a corresponding update matrix ($\Delta \mathbf{w}$) for each weight matrix in the network such that the loss function decreases.

Backpropagation primarily relies upon the [[id:81E78CCD-D786-4518-A142-5F222ACF0893][Multivariable Chain Rule]] and the [[id:13D0FE21-E196-461E-A4D7-E9F97846DE2E][Jacobian]].
