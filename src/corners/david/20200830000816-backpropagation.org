#+TITLE: Backpropagation

Backpropagation is the method through which a normal neural network trains and minimizes loss. The goal of backpropagation is compute a corresponding update matrix ($\Delta \mathbf{w}$) for each weight matrix in the network such that the loss function decreases.

Backpropagation primarily relies upon the [[id:5730680c-da0d-4475-a16f-a2005c5e7b98][Multivariable Chain Rule]] and the [[id:371d7469-9d22-490f-93bc-7d1a6f400455][Jacobian]].
