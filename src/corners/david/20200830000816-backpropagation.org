#+TITLE: Backpropagation

Backpropagation is the method through which a normal neural network trains and minimizes loss. The goal of backpropagation is compute a corresponding update matrix ($\Delta \mathbf{w}$) for each weight matrix in the network such that the loss function decreases.

Backpropagation primarily relies upon the [[file:20200901123450-multivariable_chain_rule.org][Multivariable Chain Rule]] and the [[file:20200830000754-jacobian.org][Jacobian]].
