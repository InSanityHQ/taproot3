#+TITLE: Conway Opinions
#+filetags: :fledgling:

* Caryl Phillips
- Melodramatic wording and attitude of the 1880's Europe leads to an unappealing look to the postcolonial world.
- Claims that it is unfair to judge a book on racial perceptions, which "change radically from year to year"
  - Unreasonable to expect a portrayal of Africa w/ humanity

* Chinua Achebe
- Uses Africa as a foil for Europe
- Africa's usage as a mere backdrop is dehumanizing
- Conway is racist
