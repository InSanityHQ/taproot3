Just as how water flow would be measured in kg/s, current is in units of C/s (aka an Amp) and represented by the symbol $I$. $I = \frac{\Delta V}{\text{Resistance}}$

Therefore $\text{Resistance} = R = \frac{J}{C} \cdot \frac{s}{C} = \frac{Js}{C^2} = \text{Ohm} = \Omega$

Resistance increases with longer or skinnier wires, so $R = \frac{L}{A} \cdot \text{Resistivity of material}$. Resisitivity is in units of $\Omega m$ and denoted by $\rho$.

Current can be thought of as $\frac{dQ}{dt}$.
