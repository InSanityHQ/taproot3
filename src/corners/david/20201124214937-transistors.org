* BJT
The bipolar transistor consists of three alternating semiconductors (such as NPN or PNP) and a emitter, collector, and base. 

These are used in basic circuits for [[file:20201130164732-digitallogic.org][Digital Logic]].

** NPN
A NPN BJT transistor consists of a heavily doped N-type "emitter" on one edge, a thin and lightly doped P-type "base" in the middle, and a moderately doped "collector" on the other edge. The transistor is activated through manipulation of the base current which through manipulation of the middle zone regulates the stronger collector current. 

:WARN:/ Conventional current is OPPOSITE electron flow. Current is what is amplified.
