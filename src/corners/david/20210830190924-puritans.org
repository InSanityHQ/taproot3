#+TITLE: Puritans
* General
- Pilgrims/Puritans have been depicted favorably as refugees vs people seeking profit
  - Contrast w/ Virginia
- Pilgrims and Puritans are actually different
  - Pilgrims are religious separatists who came on the /Mayflower/ in 1620
  - Puritans arrived in 1630 and founded Boston
- Great Migration brought many more to England and outnumbered Plymouth
- Argument: American origins as mirroring religion - America as Promised Land.
  - Pilgrims and puritans became important foundational myth
- America thought of as a utopia
  - Eventually hopes of discovering a utopia replaced by idea of building one
  - America thought as 'relatively empty'
- Many other groups left for freedom but none as famous as Pilgrims and Puritans
* Puritans
- Puritans made an effort to document themselves (biased)
- Didn't recognize English religious authorities as valid
  - English authorities were therefore not a fan
- John Winthrop led the first group and established themes of religious coexistence
- General comparisons to Moses/Jesus
- America was to be Canaan
- Despite focus on coexistence individuals were banned for dissenting opinion (either liberalizing or their own sect)
- Characterized by /transitions/
  - England -> North America
  - Opressed -> Opressors
  - Faith -> Doubt (concerning Promised Land)
    - Colonizing experienced turned the promised land into wildnerness
- Liberalization over time
- Eventual admittance that America has not become the Promised Land, but could become it
  - Sort of "mission of the Puritans"
- King Philip's War with Native Americans (see [[id:50A1A417-9C7C-45B8-A40D-12763127CEAB][Indigenous People's History]]) threatened colonies
  - English still did better overall though
- Witchcraft
  - Eventually forced to practice religious tolerance as a royal governor from England showed up
    - Promised Land "severly shaken"
- Puritan elite did not want to concede
- Charter revoked
- Puritan legacy is of the Promised Land: a mix of myth and reality about America
