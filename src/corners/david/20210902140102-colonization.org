* Spanish
** General Timeline
- Columbus travels in 1492 and first lands in the Bahamas. (1492-1502) 
- Colonizes it and enslaves natives (1508-1513)
  - Population started at 3 million, and when he left it was 200
  - Art depics the colonization project as very brutal (reminiscient of Hell)
  - Meta-imperialism
    - England and France justify involvement by asserting that they must rectify the Spanish situation and "colonize" the area with their moral superiority
- Hernan Cortez conquers the Aztec Empire (1519-1521)
  - Very small force of men trumps a large Empire.
    - Montezuma believed Hernan was a God so welcomed
    - Epidemics were an issue
    - Aztecs controlled many others and they turned on the Aztecs
      - Caused civil uprisings
- Conquest of Incas (1532-1672)
  - Existing civil unrest allows for easier time
- Spanish discover silver and this becomes a significant economic endeavour. (1540)
- St. Augistine happens in Florida

** Colonial Settlements
- Mostly coastal settlements.
- Controlled by Crown in a very strict fashion
- Every settlement had three things
  - Mission: a church (major focus on converting natives to Catholicism) 
  - Presidio: a fort
  - Pueblo: a town
- Goal was to be self-sufficient and send money back to mother country.
- Mercantilism
  - For economic success, a country should produce their own goods
  - Very restrictive
    - Spanish colonies could only send their good and trade with mother country
    - Some smuggling (pirates)
  - Spain was a pioneer in this regard, other powers copy this
- Strict caste hierarchy in colonies
  - Recognized all the races and had places for them in the hierarchy
    - /in a bad way/
- Spanish California
  - Last project, sparked by Russian competition
