#+title: Immigrant Visions

* PoI 
- Jewish autobiography indicates identification with story of Pilgrims and allusion to Promised Land
- /Mona and the Promised Land/ has extra focus on America as a promised land and more connections to Judaism
- /Once in a Promised Land/ further works with this idea but involves the dillusionment aspect that also plagued the Puritans

* Connections
- Clear connection to [[id:5CF06510-55A1-428C-9452-B53B93FD7A1E][Puritans]] promised land
- Tied to the [[id:605A41A4-B190-4E02-86A9-3287D3626993][Indigenous People's History]] reading in how history has had this subconscious impact on American culture?

* Question
- Does this happen in other notable immigrations? Serious fixation on America as an almost religious promised land.
