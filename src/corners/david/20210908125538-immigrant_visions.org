#+title: Immigrant Visions

* PoI 
- Jewish autobiography indicates identification with story of Pilgrims and allusion to Promised Land
- /Mona and the Promised Land/ has extra focus on America as a promised land and more connections to Judaism
- /Once in a Promised Land/ further works with this idea but involves the dillusionment aspect that also plagued the Puritans

* Connections
- Clear connection to [[id:D6027ED8-FE75-4700-8E6C-E3F3717AEDB7][Puritans]] promised land
- Tied to the [[id:50A1A417-9C7C-45B8-A40D-12763127CEAB][Indigenous People's History]] reading in how history has had this subconscious impact on American culture?

* Question
- Does this happen in other notable immigrations? Serious fixation on America as an almost religious promised land.
