- Our eyes have evolved to see color via /rods/ that see brightness and /cones/ that see color. Humans usually have 3 (red, green, blue).
  - There's some overlap in what wavelengths the cones are sensitive to
#+begin_aside Red Cones
Apparently, evolutionary biologists believe the third "red" cone developed more recently in order to help distinguish ripeness of fruits. It's not strictly necessary to see color.
#+end_aside
#+begin_aside Tetrochromats
Sometimes people can have /four/ cones, where the fourth cone's distribution is very close to the green. They can see more colors than us!
#+end_aside
- We mix red, green, and blue to get other colors
  - As a result, LCD screens and so on only output these colors
  - Spectrum of something like an LED is flat with three spikes
- Many types of color spaces
  - RGB
  - CYMK
  - HSV
  - LAB
    - Designed based on how we process colors
      - Perceptual brightness
      - Brain comparse colors on a scale from green to red, blue to yellow
- Color solids
  - 3D cube of red, green, blue
  - We can also map things to solids  a bunch of other ways:
