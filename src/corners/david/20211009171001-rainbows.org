When light enters a rainbow droplet it is first refracted, then it has a small (~6%?) chance of being reflected internally, after which it will refract once more and come out at a different angle. The angle between the original path of the light and the final path is known as the _deviation_, and is obviously dependent on the original angle relative to the droplet.
