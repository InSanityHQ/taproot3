#+TITLE: Enzymes



Enzymes are [[id:AF982AF7-0BEF-4CB6-B161-ECCB4FD3808C][proteins]] that perform specific tasks quickly. 

* Active Sites
Enzymes have active sites which bind to specific substrates and then perform an action on them (such as splitting them apart).

Chemical reactions take place at the active site. Active sites facilitate these reactions in just the right way such that it is stabler.

* Inhibitors
** Competitive Inhibitors
Competitive inhibitors reduce reaction rate but can be subverted with high concentrations.
** Noncompetitive Inhibitors
Noncompetitive inhibitors reduce reaction rate and cannot be subverted.
