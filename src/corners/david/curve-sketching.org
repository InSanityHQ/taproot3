* Curve Sketching :unit2:

Goal: Draw a graph of $f(x)$ using $f'(x)$ and $f''(x)$ (see [[id:37B59A42-8163-4417-816B-C2BA8CEA8BFD][Calculating Derivatives]]).
/Warning!/ Don't abandon precalculus knowledge and common sense! Lots of common sense is involved in this and the calculus mostly just fills in the gaps.

Two principles (really one) will aid this endeavour:
- If $f' > 0$, $f$ is increasing (and vice versa).
- If $f'' > 0$, $f'$ is increasing (and vice versa).

_Ex 1_. $f(x) + 3x - x^3$
$f'(x) = 3-3x^2 \rightarrow 3(1-x)(1+x)$
$f'(x) > 0$ in the range $-1<x<1$ and therefore $f$ is increasing in that range.
$f'(x) < 0$ in the range $1<x$ and therefore $f$ is increasing in that range (similarly for the range $x < -1$.

General shape of function can be deduced from these facts.

*DEFINITION* If $f'(x_0) = 0$, $x_0$ is a /critical point/. At this point $f(x_0)$ is called the /critical value/.
