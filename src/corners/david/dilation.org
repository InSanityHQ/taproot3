#+TITLE: Derivation of Dilation

$\Delta T = \frac{\Delta T'}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$


$\Delta T = \gamma \Delta T'$ where $\gamma = \frac{1}{sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}$

This means when v is small, gamma is ~1 and no real dilation. When v is large gamma is >1 and \Delta T is larger

This equation applies when there are two events that happen at the same location in a primed frame,
