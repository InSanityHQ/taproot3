* Epsilon Deltas
** Background

Epsilon delta proofs are rooted in the formal definition of a limit.

Algebraically/formally, this is expressed as follows:
$\lim\limits_{x \rightarrow a} f(x) = L$ means that for all $\epsilon > 0$ there exists a $\delta > 0$ such that if $0<|x-a|<\delta$ then $|f(x) - L| < \epsilon$.

Several specifications can be made here:
-  $|f(x) - L| < \epsilon$ means that the distance between L and f(x) is at most epsilon.
-  $0<|x-a|<\delta$ means that distance between a and x is less than delta, and is not zero (they are not equal)

The formal definition of a limit states that for a given epsilon (or distance from L) greater than zero, a sufficient delta (or distance from a) above zero exists fulfilling the following condition. If x is within delta of of a (but not equal to it), f(x) is within epsilon of L. This being true for all epsilons means that as epsilon goes to zero, there will be a sufficient delta such that for all x's within delta of a, f(x) will be within epsilon of L and therefore the function will approach L.

** Problems
*** Process
1. We start with our definition:   $\lim\limits_{x \rightarrow a} f(x) = L$ means that for all $\epsilon > 0$ there exists a $\delta > 0$ such that if $0<|x-a|<\delta$ then $|f(x) - L| < \epsilon$.
2. We then manipulate $|f(x) - L| < \epsilon$ such that it has $|x-a|$ on one side.
3. Using the fact that $0<|x-a|<\delta$ we can relate both variables.
4. Pick an arbitrary delta, use that to get a range of x's, and then using the relation from step 2, get a second possible value for delta in terms of epsilon. Delta is the min of the two values
5. 

*** Misc Tips
$|f(x)-L|<\epsilon = L-\epsilon < f(x) < L+\epsilon$
$0<|x-a|<\delta$ is equal to $a-\delta < x < a+\delta$ where $x \neq a$

Standard algebraic rules apply for simplification: cross-multiplication for fractions, multiplication by conjugate for fractions with radicals, and difference of squares or cubes for quadratics and cubics respectively.

* Continuity
See [[id:317D5898-0F2A-40DC-A1E4-A8A98F60B5BD][Continuity]] for types.

f is continous at a if the limit as x goes to a of f(x) exists, f(a) exists, and the limit is equal to f(a)

Making a function a function continuous everywhere is mainly ensuring that these terms apply. Look for transition points then write out how the answer satisfies them. You'll want to use systems of equations:

if the function is 

x>2  f(x)
x<=2 g(x)

then frame it as f(2) = g(2)

Continuity laws can be justified with limit laws + arithmetic.

Composition works as follows: lim(f(g(x)) = f(lim(g(x))
Also note that "If g is continuous at a and f is continuous at g(a), then f ◦ g as [f ◦ g](x) = f(g(x)) is continuous at a."

* Limit Definition of e

(1+1/x)^x as it goes to inf
(1+x)^1/x as it goes to 0
Substitution!
Exponent rules! (A^xb) = (A^x)^b

* IVT
Let f be continous between a and b, and N be a number within f(a) and f(b). There exists a c within a and b such that f(c) = N.
This has implications for root finding: set N to zero and extrapolate.
