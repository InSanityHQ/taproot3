* Thesis
The primary unit of organization for the riots in New England was the /motley crew/: a multiethnic squad associated with sailors and slaves. The diverse nature of the rioters prompted individuals like Thomas Paine to formulate a more abstract notion of a universal right to be free and have revolution. Despite American writers going back on this ideal, this concept and the motley crew itself acted as "vectors of revolution", spreading this to other societies.
