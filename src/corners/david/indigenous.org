#+TITLE: Indigenous People's History

* Argument
- America committed genocide (under UN definition)
  - Multiculturalism is a lie because Native Americans needed to be erased - multicultural people argue that "we all come to org" even though Native Americans are the true inhabitors
  - Multiculturalism is manifest destiny and was tied to genocide
- Revisionist US history
  - Unconscious belief of americans that manifest destiny was inevitable (13 colonies "needed" it)
- Corn was part of American culture
  - Main staple of agriculture in America
  - Native American culture spread throughout the globe via corn
  - It originated in southern american and moved into america via Texas. Mesoamerica -> America -> Europe -> World
  - Irrigation systems bolstered their agriculture sector and this was the focus of their innovation
    - Tech was advanced, but in a different way.
      - Better usage of crops
      - Better upkeep (forest backburning, trails, etc.)
- Culture
  - Leaders went through heritage
  - Women were able to remove representative (as they were the "mother" of the tribe)
  - US constituional democracy inspired by Iroqoui Confederacy
- Native Americans also known as "people of the corn"
- Corn influenced road development
  - Roads trace waterways
  - Not actually skinny trails but large wide-pathed networks
* Connections
  - Quotes Mann a lot and furthers their argument
* Perspective
  - Current understanding is biased; American understanding is revisionist and intentionally flawed.
