#+TITLE: The Unifications of Italy and Germany

* Nationalism and the Nation-State
- Signficant conservatism backswing was the response to [[id:25D6CD1E-8F4D-4EC9-A12D-0CE553052BF4][The People's Spring]].
- Rise of /the nation-state/, a political unit comprised of people of one nationality.
- Nation-states were mainly France and England before 1860
  - Revolution helped foster this mentality to a degree
  - Related to popular nationalism (described in [[id:25D6CD1E-8F4D-4EC9-A12D-0CE553052BF4][The People's Spring]]).
- Common group of people with culture and aspirations
- Artists promote patriotism and nationalism
- Nationalism within larger multicultural states promoted separatism
- Nationalism in upper class promoted irredentism (demand for territory that is not yours) and this led to unification in Germany and Italy

* Crimean War
- Brutal war with disease and trench warfare
- Weakened Russia, Britain, France, and Ottomans
  - All forces that sought to preserve current system
- Sardinia participated

* Unification of Italy
- Prior to 1860 Italy was split into a dozens of states, some large, some small
- Larger amounts of popular nationalism spread across Italy in 1848
- Sardinia was successful in military so others wished to join
- Nation-state mentality incentivized unification in language as well

* Unification of Germany
- Otto von Bismarck led this
  - Solely wanted to cement German power (a la Raison d'etat)
  - Rejection of liberalism of 1848 with "blood and iron"
  - Wanted to remove Austria from German affairs to allow Prussia control
- Added southern German states
- Provoked Napoleon and trounced him

* Austria-Hungary
- Weakened Austria unified with Hungary as compromise
- Dual constitutions and parliament but same ruling family
- Hurt Slavics, Czechs, Poles, Slovaks
  - Nationality could not be resolved and would snowball until WW1

* Implications
- Civic nationalism in Germany and Italy
  - Outside support
- Poles were not so lucky
  - Had to wait until WW1
- Two new large states
- Germany now second most populous
  - Triumphed over both France and Austria
  - Serious competitor
