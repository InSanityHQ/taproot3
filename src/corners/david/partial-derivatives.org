* Basic Summary
Partial derivatives are in many ways the same thing as a regular [[id:37B59A42-8163-4417-816B-C2BA8CEA8BFD][derivative]], but for multivariate functions. The partial derivative of a function $f$ with respect to an argument $x$ is denoted by $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}$. One holds each of the other variables (those not in the derivative) constant in the function and takes the derivative in a regular fashion. Partial derivatives describe how much an infinitesmal change in one variable influences the overall change of the function. As a result, these are very useful in fields like machine learning and science.

*EXAMPLE*

$f(x,y) = e^{2y}\sin{x}$
To find $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}$ one would hold $y$ constant and proceed as normal.
$\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} f(x,y) = e^{2y}\cos{x}$
