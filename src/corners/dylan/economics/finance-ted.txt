# Finance whatever - Ted

will be talking about money

What does money "mean"? What value does it bring? WHy do we have it?

# What can money do?
Facilitate transactions
Assess value of goods/services/power
Compare values
	- Numeraire :: Acts as a denominator

Mapping of money to actual object utility is iffy and is dynamic
Can we really compare everything that has a monetary value?
For the most part money works

Money has value because each person believes (1) other people will think that the paper has value because they think that goto (1)
Fiat money - value isn't intrinsic, isn't attached to anything
