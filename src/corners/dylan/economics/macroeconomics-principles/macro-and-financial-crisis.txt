# Macroeconomics and the financial system
Banks are made up of balance sheets, leverage, and non-linearities
Balance Sheets:
* When borrowing money, there exists two types of money: debt and equity (your money)
* Leverage = Assets / Equity
* Amount of money you borrow vs how much you buy with that money makes a difference
* To know the risk of a position you need a balance sheets
* Balance sheets contain all assets and liabilities (equity under liabilities) //Assets = Liabilities
Leverage:
* Banks hold equity as a hedge against possible asset loss
* How much leverage / equity a bank should have is a central question of macroeconomics
* More equity: Safer but less profit
* Buncha equations
* Bank's leverage ratio is Deposits + Capital / Capital
* Banks go broke if the value of assets is less than the value of deposits
* Banks choose the amount they lend by making sure that P(p < 1 - (K/aL)) <= some number, e.g. 5%
* Equity should be large enough to absorb a large loss
* both alpha and K are factors in determining the risk of a bank
* US banks generally have lower leverage ratios because they have higher rate of lending out; EU banks own a lot of safe government bonds
