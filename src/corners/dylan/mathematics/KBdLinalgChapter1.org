* Complex Number Review

Notes taken on (12/7/21)

Complex numbers were invented so that we can represent $\sqrt{-1}$.

A complex number is an ordered pair of numbers $(a, b)$, and is represented as $a + bi$.
The set of all complex numbers is $C = \{a + bi : a, b \in \mathbb{R}\}$.

Addition and subtraction works pretty standardly; $(a + bi) + (c + di) = (a + c) + (b + d)i$.

There's also the powers of $i$, but this is trivial.

Complex number properties:
- Commulative :: $\alpha + \beta = \beta + \alpha$
- Associative :: $(\alpha + \beta) + \lambda = \alpha + (\beta + \lambda)$; $(\alpha\beta)\lambda = \alpha(\beta\lambda)$
- Identities :: $\alpha + 0 = \alpha$; $\alpha\cdot 1 = \alpha$
- Multiplicative Inverse :: $\forall\alpha\exists\beta: \alpha\beta = 1$
- Distributive :: $\lambda(\alpha + \beta) = \lambda\alpha + \lambda\beta$

The book goes into proving this but I won't do that here. Also, in Axler, $\mathbb{F}$ will mean either $\mathbb{C}$ or $\mathbb{R}$. Theorems that work for $\mathbb{F}$ will work for both $\mathbb{C}$ and $\mathbb{R}$.

If $\alpha \in \mathbb{F}$, then $\alpha$ is a scalar. Definition of a scalar. Axler rambles about powers of numbers now, but it's pretty self-evident so I won't cover this here.

Then he talks about $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\mathbb{C}^n$. The formal definition for a particular $n$ (e.g. 2) is $\mathbb{R}^2 = \{(a, b) : a, b \in \mathbb{R}\}$. To abstract this for any $n$, we go over lists. The notation for lists is $(x_1, ..., x_n)$. Lists are always finite in length. We can have an empty list: $()$. Lists care about their order and repetitions. Using lists, we can define $\mathbb{F}^n$ as

\begin{aligned}
\mathbb{F}^n = \{(x_1, ..., x_n) : x_j \in \mathbb{F} \text{ for } j = 1, ..., n\}
\end{aligned}

Most of the content following this is redundant review that doesn't introduce anything new so I will skip it.

Also, sometimes when we add 0, we actually mean a list full of zeroes.

* Vector Space Definition

Notes taken on (12/7/21)

A vector space is a /set/ such that *addition* and *scalar multiplication* are defined like in $\mathbb{F}^n$. That is, for a vector space $V$

\begin{aligned}
u + v \in V &\text{ given } u, v \in V \\
\lambda v \in V &\text{ given } \lambda \in \mathbb{F} \text{ & } v \in V \\
\end{aligned}

Formally, a vector space is a set that follows the rules above, as well as holds the following properties:

- *Commulative*
- *Associative*
- *Identities*
- *Additive Inverse*
- *Distributive Property*

Elements of a vector space are called *Vectors* or *Points*. Also, when you need to be precise about what type of scalar you multiply by for scalar multiplication, you can say that $V$ is a *vector space over* $\mathbb{F}$, for example. Usually it's implied in the vector space definition.

The notation $\mathbb{F}^{S}$ denotes the set of functions from $S$ to $\mathbb{F}$.

- $f + g \in \mathbb{F}^{S}$ means that $(f + g)(x) = f(x) + g(x)$.
- $\lambda f \in \mathbb{F}^{S}$

Also, for the rest of the book, $V$ will notate a vector space over $\mathbb{F}$.

* Subspaces

Notes taken on (12/7/21)

The definition of a subspace is as follows:

*If* $U \subset V$ *and* $U$ *is a vector space, then* $U$ *is a subspace*.

Note that $U$ has to follow the same addition and multiplication as $V$.
