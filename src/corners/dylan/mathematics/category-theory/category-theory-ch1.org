* Basic stuff first
We can divide a set into a set of subsets of the original set, such that their disjoint union is the original set. We call this a _partition_ on the original set.
For example, if $A = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}$, then the set of subsets $Part_{A} = \{\{1, 2\}, \{3, 4\}}$ is a partition on $A$.
We can think of a partition as a surjective map from the original set to another set, such that elements with the same image are in the same set in the partition.
That is, formally, a partition "is" a surjective map $f: A \twoheadrightarrow X$, where the partition is given by $Part_{f} = \{\{f(b)|b\in A, f(a) = f(b)\}|a\in A\}$
