#+AUTHOR: Dylan Wallace

Personal Note: Video/transcript available online (on youtube) so notes will be running(?) in nature

* Background
* Comonads & coalgebras, monads & algebras
* Topological space: Points C_p(1) , basic opens M_p(1)
* Two toposes associated to p
* Monad map M_p -> [C_p, M_p+1]
