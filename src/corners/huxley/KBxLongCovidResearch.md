- published more recently


Ingredients (NOT SURE):
forsythia, honeysuckle, almond, banlangen, cordate houttuynia, ageratum, pieplant, rhodiola root, menthol, liquorice

bottom line:
Seems that people agree that it helps treat symptoms, but it has not been verified as a medicine specifically for treating covid. 
It seems that it is safe, and won't do harm.


## flo on [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXY6QUdMSIY)

- lots of data collection from a covid symptom tracker app
	- data is skewed towards older and white (~54yo)
