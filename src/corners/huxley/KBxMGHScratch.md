## mgh!

- start off just by graphing it? seeing if it moves like weather.


- predict mutation and mutation speed?

- https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8250893/ LMAO they use *actual* weather, not weather techniques


we could use GNNs? message passing convolution *is* infection.


super cheap camera tempature sensor for fever detection of others..? 


- we can talk to kathy about this



- try to trace connections between known cases? essentially, edge prediction task for covid modeling.
	- google mobility data?



- ofc, can use other sicknesses (common cold)
	- and then do some type of transformation which relates them
