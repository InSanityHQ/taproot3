# Day one? alright.
1/9.

a little bit of hw, probs 1.5 hours 
specific, help us get to the right answer, not about elegance

recommends, spread it out. don;t do all the hw at once.

## test taking tech

for when you reach a problem, and you don;t know how to solve

```ad-important
marking stuff up is very important!!
```

this is a trick test. they try to mess with you. this is about puzzling things out.

READ. THE. QUESTION. 
underline the question! every time! 

### tech 1: plugin
avoid, 0, 1, 2. go with 3!

declare variables!

under one minute mark, check it! even if you know it!
essentially always check,


### tech 2: backsolve!
wait, just, binary search?
if you find the one that works, your done!
start in the middle, b or c

remember, greater than or equal to!


## Writing and Language
learn a dozen rules, and the rest just falls out. meatgrinder it!


**read everything**
the information you need is typically *around* the underlined part. build context!

the ear is a good tool. sounds wrong? probably wrong.


if you have a contrast, it needs to be a but.


### puntuation
- independant clauses can stand on their own
- dependent clauses need to be attached to an indipendent clause

- indipendent and dependent clauses are around 70% of the questions


#### semicolon
joins two independant clauses!
can only use if both sides are sentences.

#### commons
- we can join two indipendent clauses with a FANBOYS conjunction (for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so)

- dependent to indipendent, JUST use a comma. no fanboys

- seperate items of a list

- offset parenthetical phrases
	- clause in the middle of a sentence that you could take out and maintiain grammer
		- if you have a comma on side of a parenthetical, you need one on the other side!
	- if you remove the parenthetical, you have to remove the commas as well. no pause!


#### colon
can use if what's to the left is complete, and the right elaborates on the left.

"such as" and "including" means nothing after.

#### dashes
- dashes can be used exactly like a colon,

- or like the commas which offset a parenthetical phrase.


if a period and a semicolon are being used in the same way, they are both wrong. same is true for dashes and commas?
