## hw review

read where the symbols are carefully


- they are gonna give you equations in the wrong form!
always change their form
- if denominators, get rid of them

- get comfortable using fractions on the answer side!
	- much better than decimals
- 

- prepositional? parenthetical? what are these
	- prepositional can just be removed. do it!
- 


- sentence additions deletion 
	- pay attention to the rational before the yes or no!


## core math

- index of median in 101 long is ((101-1)/2) + 1 = 51
convert to even, then add one!

- range is the largest val minus the smallest val

tip: get comfortable doing this by hand! else, hard to find mistakes


### exponents
x^y+x^y = x^2y (just add)
x^a/x^b = x^(b-a) (just subtract)
convert fractional exponenets to radicals
like so: x^(a/b) = broot(x^a)
if a > b, then you can break things apart into separate radicals


### geo

we need:
- pythag!
- similar triangle ratios
	- corresponding sides share a common ratio

tip: if they give you a shape, turn it into a right triangle or a rectangle


need to #review these..


### linear graphs

bottom number of slope is x value, and y is the top value

- almost never give u info that u dont need


### baby trig
just write down sohcahtoa
this is almost all the harder math

identities they care about:
sin x = cos(90-x)

- special triangles
	- 45, 45, 90 
		- equal sides x, hypotenuse is sqrt(2)
		- 1:1:sqrt(2)
	- 30 60 90
		- opposite 30 is x
		- opposite 60 is x sqrt 3
		- hypotenuse is 2
		- 1: sqrt(3) : 2


- right triangles: 
	- almost always gonna be 
		- 3 4 5
		- 5 12 13
#review this too...


###  circles

ratio will remain consistent between area angle and circumfrance when u get a sector?

positive x squared and y sqaured means it's a circle, but not nessasarrily in standard form
