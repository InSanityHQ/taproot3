## reading
we get, so much low handing fruit in the reading section with just a few core ideas.


maintain focus!

write down main ideas! every paragraph

process of elim is the STRAT.
- much easier to remove wrong answers than find the right one

how to get rid of wrong ones?
two types of wrong answers: 
- half true
	- one word or phrase which makes it false
	- check if all the info is in there! if one word is wrong, the whole thing is wrong.
- non-answer
	- true, but doesnt adress the question!
	- make sure to check: **does it answer the question?**

## algebra 1
always change the form! just do what you can
if you see denominators, get rid of them! multiply them out.

not just about solving for x! most of the times you have to do something the answer
sometimes, you dont even have to solve for x

just take a few seconds to think about what the question is **actully** asking
oppurtunities for shortcuts


getting things into y=mx+b is helpful
averages are helpful


tons of systems questions! 


most common is standard form, Ax + By = c

the solution to a system of equations is where the two lines intercept

if you can identify the forms, then u can same a lot of time

solving: substitution and elimination






## hw
// everything past intepreting and designing algebraic equations

reading 1 hw
algebra 1 hw
finish the algebra 1 packet
dont forget about plugin and backsolve! the only thing that matters is getting the right answer.
