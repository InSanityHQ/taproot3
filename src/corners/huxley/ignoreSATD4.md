## writing and language 
- prepositional phrases
	- start with a preposition, then reference an object
		- ie. "on my smartphone"
	- cross out the parentheticals! we dont need them 
	- and prepositions?

### verb tense
- tense will be established somewhere around where you need it
	- in sentences before, after, ect.
	
### pronouns
- on the SAT, they is strictly plural! 
	- need to use gendered pronouns
	
- case change?
- cross out attached nouns!


### parrelism

## data analysis
look at the axis! pay attention to what you are measuring, the units, absolute valued, ect

- look for relationships

- think in terms of proportions

- box plots 
	- learn how these work!
	- something about quartiles? #review
- review intuitive understanding of standard deviation #review 

## data gathering
a census is a snapshot of the entire population
a survey is a much smaller thing


- watch for when we can't make generalizations
	- location skews the result
	- two unlike populations
	- or a small sample size
