huh, got a decent ammount wrong here.. review!!



## reading

the answers are normally boring. be skeptical of emotional and absolute / powerful words. they mean them literally!
careful about "all." they mean it! 

**avoid extreme or absolute answers.**

avoid overly specific answers. it's most likely saying something that is *just* off. the passages are general, so are the answers.
actully more important than you probably think right now.


### words in context
: avoid looking at answers as much as you can!
	- look for the context first, and then go back to the question. don't let the answers bias you!
	- always eliminate the common use of the word answer. they are not using the common use of the word!


## evidence based!
*the silver bullet.*
do them backwards!

read the first of the pair, then just ignore the answers! don;t look at them!
go to the next question, and eliminate wrong answers.

ask, "which of these addresses the ideas in the previous question?"
this way, you won;t talk yourself into bad answers.

80% of the time, you can eliminate two of the answers this way.
if you have two, then look for the best pair! choosing the best pair will most likely be clearer than choosing the best individual answers.

## data analysis
it's all over the place!

**read the axis!** what are the units? is it percentage? absolute val?
look for **trends**

go through each answer, and make sure you can eliminate all the wrong answers.


## algebra
remember to factor stuff out!
also, remember difference of sqaures!

regonize the forms on the common polynomyals

frick gotta review factoring well

min or max is the vertex of the parabola
the vertex is $\frac{-b}{2a}$


## hw
algebra 2 hw
algebra 2 packet 
- reading 2 hw
