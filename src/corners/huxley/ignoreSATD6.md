if their are two that are similar, it means one of those two are most likely going to be right
eliminate the nonsense first


bbacccddbdbcacbcaddabcbbaacbdbdaaaacddbbacaaaddaadd

if it says conclusion, look to the end!
look at the title. they are pretty good overviews

when there is a shift in what they are talking about, then the answer will be general!
don't look at just the first or the second half

so general it almost says nothing at all is where you want to live on the SAT

review circles!

## writing and language packet 3

brevity is your friend! if you can cut out words without changing the meaning, do it.
they have simple redundant info! be careful of this. ie, "every year.... anually"

### formality and colloquialism  
#contact actully

- formality is like business casual
	- dont use elementary school language
	- slangy language
	- or overly ornate stuff
	
## special purpose questions

pay super close attention to what you are *actully* being asked. think about checking the boxes that the question is giving you!

## sentence additions / deletions
ignore the yes/no part of it! just focus on the rational.

secondary filter should be whether or not it is relavent to the passage

## sentence placement

go to the sentence in question. consider it in isolation. based on the content of that sentence, imagine what kind of info should come before and come after.

focus on the words in the front! "however," -> it's a counterpoint
think about each sentence closing and then opening something.

## transitions

micro and macro 
both the first and last sentences are transition sentences

micro, read the sentence before and then, and think about the relationship. once you do this, then look to the actual questions.


if there is a not only, then there will be a but also
