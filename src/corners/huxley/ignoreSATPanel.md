### for later, sat!

- dylan's advice
	- if you arn't good at the math section, just grind math! **just grind. 3 hours a day.**
- take practice tests when you are going to take the actual test
- reading questions:
	- do the evidence question before the first one!

#### question time

- how should you train if you misread a lot of problems?
	- underline very single word that is vaugely important
		- numbers, proper nouns, non generic nouns, everything that's not FANBOYS? uht-
	- math section, 
		- happens a lot of on the proportionaly sections
			- just immediently transalate into equations! while you read!
	- practice is the only real thing to fix. 
		- don't speed through the easy questions that you might misread!
	- when you read a question, say it back to yourself 
		- "what collede board says is x"
		- -> 3b = c
	- or, look at the rest for context and then judge
	
***

you are reviewing a practice test, how do aproach something that you got wrong?

- look at the answer key, and then write down what the actual **mistake** was.
	- then get a lesson
	
- the SAT has question templates
	- as long as you remember how you learn things, then you can solve similar questions in every test
- track questions how you miss!
	- write down the process for how you solve things! as if they are future instructions

- running on intuition in the very beginning
	- there are very specific templates 
	- khan academy! very in the beginning as they single out the different templates
	
- early on, it's about content
	- then the mistakes are about
	- "stupid" mistakes are not a thing. there is always a reason! pin point down that reason.
	- "not reading carefully" is not explaining anything! think, again, about the **actual** reason.
	- take a test where you are documenting everything
		- and then you will start to see patterns emerge
		
- bridge water
	- do the questions!
- reach the "zen" state
- not about the content, just about the framework

zooming out: what was the general arc of the test prep process?

- albert
	- PSAT: bad
	- spent half of thanksgiving break doing SAT
	
- dhruv
	- ?

- david
	- started a few months before
	- practice tests every week! fine tuning

- akshay
	- didnt start prepping until after the PSAT
	- that was a little less than 2 months
	- not more than 4 hours a weekend

- jack 
	- sprinted for 3.5 months, of weekly practice tests!
	- longer you prep, not the better you score!

- dylan
	- really actully started in mid september before the psat
	- in regard to the practice test scores:
		- if you are lazy, then your real test scores will be higher than your practice test scores

- abi 
	- weekly practice tests
	- lot's of khan
	- week before: daily practice tests!
	- intense practice test taking was very helpful. good for building stamina!

- lauren
	- panicked! took a diagnostic over the summer
	- and then.. did something else? didnt catch it.

resources? and also, worst advice!


- lauren
	- "you need a tutor" -> you don't need a tutor, tbh
	- something about the redbook?

- abi
	- don't read the questions and then read the passage
	- just do them as they come!
	- if you have two passages, answer all the things about the first passage, and then do the second one, answer those, and then do the comparison questions
	- people like the blackbook!
	
- dylan 
	- if you feel anxious a lot, don't eat breakfast?
	- dont eat sugary things! in the morning
	- timers, are very important. measure how much time you have left / # problems = amount of time you could have spent reviewing?

- jack
	- the worst advice he got: annotate!
	- don't annotate. #todo ask @jemoka about this.
	- dont transfer the bubbles? what?
	- only use the official practice tests.
	- princeton review! it's fantastic. 
	- online version don't correlate super well with the actual score

- akshay: disagrees!
	- khan is great
		- mini sections are very good
		- reading section explanantions are not great
		- shorter is better unless it intterupts parrelel strucutre
		- make sure you compare two things that are the same!
			- ie. horse's saddle vs horse
		- make sure you have semetric punctuation, "just google the rules!"
	- worst peice of advide: you don;t need to know extranious knowledge!
	- practice taking a test with a mask on

- david
	- balance it out: long and shallow? it still works in the end
	- well, too bad!
	- pracact.com? #todo ask jack about this again!
	- reddit sat form
