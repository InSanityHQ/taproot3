#+title: Rotating Chain Experiment: Presentation Organization
#+author: Houjun Liu

* Simulation and Table
- Having a table/something to push against is good
- Bring the discussion to focus on normal force 

* Boustrophedon Experiments
- Rough bottoms would cause kickoff
- Flakoi, et. al.
- Pivots and Divits:
  - Pivots: pinchy! happens in chain fountain in ddition to normal kickoff
  - Divits: normal force on bottom with rough bottom is stronger
