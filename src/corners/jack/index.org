#+AUTHOR: Houjun Liu

Hello! Welcome to my corner of personal notes in Taproot.

* About
For a little bit about me, checkout [[https://www.jemoka.com/][my web presense]]! I will be here soon to update some thoughts about stuff and probably also mirror my [[https://medium.com/20minuterants][blog]].

I am one of the primary maintainers of Taproot, and the author of the [[https://github.com/InSanityHQ/taproot3/][current build system]]. As with most other members here, I go to school at [[https://www.nuevaschool.org][The Nueva School]], an independent school in the San Francisco bay area.

Hopefully, there will be more here. Soon; soon...
