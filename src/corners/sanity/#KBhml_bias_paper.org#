* What units or aspects of the class did you find most challenging this semester? What study habits or activities helped you cope with those challenges, and/or what did not work as well?
I was initially a little bit concerned by my ability to connect theory to computation --- as I have had the usual reticence of diving into theory. However, I think the ample reference to research papers and the continuance on connection between the theoretical basis and mathematical simulations (which are much less analytical) allowed me to cope with and actually better my understand of theory.

* What units or aspects did you find most interesting or engaging? Why were you drawn to this particular material? What do you envision doing with it in the future?
I was drawn to the analytic and simulational capabilities of the Chain fountain problem. The problem's classical mechanics grounds seemed to offer the best route to the modeling of computational simulation, and connected well to my current advanced mechanics knowledge. I hope to continue an investigation into mechanics in the future with better analytical tools as well as the current tools of modeling.
