#+title: ML Bias Paper
#+author: Houjun Liu

* Participation
- Study participants didn't knowingly participate

* Process and Progress
1. Isolate the concerns
2. Don't want to post questions onto the internet: asking people who know us to listen past ignorance

TODO: 2 paragraph summary of the paper. Keep the circle small by coming up a clear method of action. Interesting question about whether its phenology or expression.

- Identify the problem + flag points
- Get together & put together next setups
