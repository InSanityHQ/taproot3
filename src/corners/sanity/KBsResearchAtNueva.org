Needfinding!

** Ted's Goals
- Expand the scope of Nueva research into non-bio research
- Also creating an infrastructure to coordinate Research initiative at Nueva
- There is interest in physics research; and that there are research projects being done in CS
- Independent studies does /not/ serve the goal of research: coordinate things that are already being done, and bring them together in an infrastructure at Nueva
- Build out the thing that are already robust as part of XRT
- <> Tanya + Sarah (environmental research) as well

Is it useful and possible?

** Thingys
- Project Management: applies to larger projects 
  - Ted classes
  - XRT L1
- Outside Mentorship 
- Statistics

** Segmentation into Wavetable
- Goal in Research: ways of extending wavetable
  - Implement the teams is very similar
  - Research in wavetable statistics
    
- <> how to build into the process how to teach what we want to support
  - Curate an enviroment that's portable that can support the Research experience
  - Even into third world
  - analogies are a little vague


"The walls are glass walls for a reason"

- Research is broadly collaborative
- Mental model from "single research" is no longer happening
- We could also, in principle, expand research collaboration with other schools <> Saint Anns, Pingry, etc.,
- With Zoom, collaboration becomes much easier

**Leverage Zoom broadly**

- Infrastructure should be broad enough to cover educational research
- Nueva's research-based education is not super formal
- Research does /not/ need to be hypothesis-driven research (i.e. observational research)

Math

- Problem Solving vs.
- Research

Problem of understanding the world vs. solving problems

<>Systems Thinking

Include elements that **leverage** design thinking into something much more open-ended.

- Directional thing: podcasts?
- The thing that we are studying and the way that we are studying it is very different
- How do we sell Nueva as a place?
- Reach out to other high schoolers
