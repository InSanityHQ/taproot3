Given functions $f(n)$ and $g(n)$, if:

\begin{equation}
    \lim_{n\to \infty} \left(\frac{f(n)}{g(n)}\right) = 1
\end{equation}

we say that $f \sim g$.

That -- the relationship between $f$ and $g$ grows in a similar fashion as $n$ increases. For instance:

- $f(n) = n+1$
- $g(n) = n+2$

Therefore:

\begin{equation}
   f\sim g = \lim_{n\to \infty} \frac{f(n)}{g(n)} = \lim_{n\to \infty} \frac{n+1}{n+2} = 1
\end{equation}

The $\sim$ operator is /commutative/ ($f \sim g \Rightarrow g\sim f$) and /transitive/ ($f\sim g, g\sim h \Rightarrow f \sim h$).

* o(n)
Given two functions $f(n)$, $g(n)$, if their relationship shows:

\begin{equation}
   \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{f(n)}{g(n)} = 0
\end{equation}

we can write it as

\begin{equation}
  f = o(g)  
\end{equation}

This tells us that if $n$ becomes very large, $g$ becomes much larger than $f$. $f$ does not grow nearly as fast as $g$.

The operation is /not/ commutative, but is /transitive/ ($f = o(g), g = o(h) \Rightarrow f = o(h)$)

* O(n)
Given two functions $f(n)$, $g(n)$.

\begin{equation}
   \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{f(n)}{g(n)} < \infty
\end{equation}

that the relationship between $f(n)$ and $g(n)$ is countable as $n$ trends to infinity.

We can also say that, given $n$, $n_0$, and some $c$ which $\forall n, n > n_0$, there is:

\begin{equation}
   |f(n)| < |cg(n)| 
\end{equation}

This tells us that $f(n)$ does not grow much much faster than $g(n)$.

Therefore:

- If $f \sim g$, $f = O(g)$ (as they grow together, $f$ is not much faster)
- If $f = o(g)$, $f=O(g)$ (as $f$ does not grow at all, $f$ is not faster)

* $\theta$(n) 
$f=\theta(g)$ IFF $f=O(g)$ and $g=O(f)$, its essentially $\sim$ but without the strict requirement of a 1:1 ratio.

* $\omega$(n) and $\Omega$(n)
The inverses of $O$ and $o$:

- $f(n) = O(g(n)) \Rightarrow g(n) = \omega(f(n))$
- $f(n) = o(g(n)) \Rightarrow g(n) = \Omega(f(n))$
