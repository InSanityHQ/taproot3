* Motivation: Fibonacci series
Each number is the sum of two previous numbers, we all know it:

\begin{equation}
   1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,\ldots 
\end{equation}

How many digits does the /billionth/ number have? We obviously can't just compute it.

* Motivation: Bernie Sanders Memes???
- $T(n) = 3$
- $T(n) = T(n-1) + 2T(n-1) - 2T(n-2)$

That, the first $T(n-1)$ are the meme makers of the day, $2T(n-1)$ are the newly anointed meme makers, and $2T(n-2)$ are the tired meme-makers.

Let's, instead, guess that there is some kind of exponential relationship, in perspective to a variable $r$ with a few degrees of freedom:

\begin{align}
&T(n) = T(n-1) + 2T(n-1) - 2T(n-2) \\
&T(n) -T(n-1) - 2T(n-1) + 2T(n-2) = 0  \\
&r^n -r^{ n-1 } - 2r^{n-1} + 2^{n-2} = 0  \\
&r^n -3r^{ n-1 } + 2^{n-2} = 0  \\
&r^{n-2} (r-2)(r-1)= 0  \\
&r=\{0,1,2\}
\end{align}

So there must be some kind of exponential relationship:

\begin{equation}
   T(n) = a(1^n) + b(2^n) + c(0^n) 
\end{equation}

We can finally solve for $a$ and $b$ given the base cases: then we know that $b=3$, $a=-3$.
