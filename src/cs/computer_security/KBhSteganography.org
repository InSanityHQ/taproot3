Steganography ("steg") is the practice of concealing information within other, more innocuous piece of information. Such techniques allow for both a mild form of encryption --- though, it is necessarily noted that the fundamental concepts of steg, inherently, does not provide adequate encryption --- and the deniability for having sent a piece of information.

A majority of the steg systems is centered around the hiding of data inside images because of the fact that subtle sub-pixel alterations could be made.
