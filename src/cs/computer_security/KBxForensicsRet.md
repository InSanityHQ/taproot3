# Forensics

I tried to do this challenge: https://www.honeynet.org/challenges/forensic-challenge-13-a-message-in-a-picture/

And I failed! Utterly and entirely. Unfortunately I have very little time to spend on this outside of class until the 16th because of my mathematical modeling contest. Perhaps I will revisit it after.


Doing steganography seems like a lot of guess and check, of which I guessed the wrong things. I spent most of my time looking into LSB, a technique for encoding messages in images by modifying the Least Significant Bit.


I tried something out of my comfort zone, and I didn't succeed. I normally have the luxury to go back and refine until I do, but unfortunately deadlines do not permit that this time around. However, I will most likely revisit this assignment after the contest, as I'm not satisfied with my progress.
