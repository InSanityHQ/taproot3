# Internet Security


go to website -> website gives certificate -> which is singed using the banks private key and verified by our browser with the public key

**basic outline:**
-  Authentication 
	-  the person you are communicating with is infact the bank

-  TLS (transport layer security)
	-  privacy
	-  generate symmetric key
		-  with asymmetric protocol?
		
- Untampered 
	- hashes a message, gives the hash, checks the hashes against eachother to make sure they havent been tampered with
	
and now, we can send in the authentication credentials (password)

### Factors
also, 2FA! or rather, 3FA? multi-factor auth.
types of factors: 
something i know, something i am, and something i have -> password, fingerprints, phone number
2FA usually uses the first and the last, whereas iphone uses the first and the second.
