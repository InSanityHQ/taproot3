# User Stories

## what are they
- it's a story! not a spec. a *story*
	- thus, we have a:
		- main character
		- character bg
		- a plot
		- climax and res
		- etc.

> "the history of technology is the history of cool tech which never got shipped"

- timmy, johhny and spike is a [great example](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/making-magic/timmy-johnny-and-spike-2013-12-03) of a user story
	- people are *named*. because they are *people* (figurtively)
		- ~~the names kernel. micro, kernel.~~

- the flow
	- p1: describe the user
		- write them in a way such that you can picture them in ur head!
	- p2: describe the "need statement"
		- [this person] cus of [these things] combined with [situation] needs a solution which solves [this concrete problem]
	- p3: what will the user be able to do and what they will feel
		- will probs find that we want more features than we have time to build
			- have to figure out which is which! this section is where we figure out how to differentiate.

### writing 
Sarah has just started a higher level math class. She enjoys math, always carries a massive notebook with her, and has a favorite pencil. She has just been told that she has to submit her homework in $\LaTeX$. She doesn't yet know what that means.

Sarah is led to Overleaf, and tries to write our her familiar equations in the strange new language. After struggling for an extended period of time, Sarah now has an unreadable line which seems to somehow generate a mangled looking equation. Sarah is no longer looking forward to her next math assignment.

Sarah needs to submit her homework in Latex, but doesn't know how to use it. She doesn't have interest in learning how. She needs a way to easily generate Latex which doesn't have an intense learning curve and is close to the speed of writing by hand.
