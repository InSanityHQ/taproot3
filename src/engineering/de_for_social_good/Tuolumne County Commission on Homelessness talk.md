# Tuolumne County Commission on Homelessness
w/ @[Dana Butow](https://cafwd.org/news/housing-leader-finds-room-to-make-a-difference-in-homelessness-in-tuolumne-county/)!

- putting all homeless people into one category is not valid

but first,

## what is the homelessness crisis?

> "the cause is, unequivocally, lack of housing"

hm. perhaps the ultimate cause...

> "public money is required"

thus, the money needs to be subsidized

> “I am for doing good to the poor, but I differ in opinion of the means. I think the best way of doing good to the poor, is not making them easy in poverty, but leading or driving them out of it. In my youth I traveled much, and I observed in different countries, that the more public provisions were made for the poor, the less they provided for themselves, and of course became poorer. And, on the contrary, the less was done for them, the more they did for themselves, and became richer.” — benjamin franklin

`article 34` states that "afforable housing that is publicaly funded is prohibited to be built unless the majority is not affordable" where "affordable" is defined as.. targeted towards those with lower income? ← wrong! she is wrong. not what it says.

> The article is a provision of California’s state Constitution that requires voter approval before [public housing](https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2021-08-23/luxury-apartment-lower-rent-affordable-housing-california-middle-class) is built in a community. [(source)](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-03-14/why-killing-article-34-on-affordable-housing-has-been-hard)

what the article *actually* states: [official doc](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=CONS&division=&title=&part=&chapter=&article=XXXIV)

we have *unsanctioned* camps which are bad news
→ claims that this is because its not managed by the government
???????

the question becomes: why has this failed to get passed in the past?

thought: idk if any of these are gonna work. they are directly contrary to the core tenet of capitalism, which is "private vice for public virtue"
dana keeps talking about how to make things politically viable, or how to show to the people of the town that this is an important issue. I don't buy that we can rely on the good of peoples hearts to solve issues like these.


## the why and how of local community involvement

- local is significantly more easily influenced
	- so start local!
	- truly somewhere where you can make an impact.
		- so, get to know the local decision makers!

> "always keep in mind the people you are trying to help." 
> don't get caught up in the minute drama! come back to "the face of someone you are trying to help."
> don't "let the perfect be the enemy"

## to morgan
> "what type of initiative do you wish you could support in your community?"
> "what ideas do you have to start getting involved or increase your involvement"

- homelessness
- misinformation
- echo chambers
- covid 

Hi Morgan!

In my immediate community, I see a lot of my peers struggling with mental health issues. I also see the ways that the pandemic is being managed as needing some support. However, I don't know if I'm the right one to provide this support.

I also wish I get could involved in solving the issues of homelessness, especially after growing up in SF and reading more about the current activism over the past few days. An issue I don't see a lot of activism over is the issue of misinformation and echo chambers. I would love to try and get involved in tackling these issues.

As for getting involved, I think the first step to all of these is learning about the issue. I find that often the causes and pathways of issues like these are significantly different than what is expected, and reading up on the actual pathways and the work done by people who have already done deep thinking about the issue with an open mind is crucial.

 Thanks,
- Huxley
