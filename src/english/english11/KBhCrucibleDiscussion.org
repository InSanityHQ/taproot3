- People enslaved by an ideology, Tituba enslaved by the propergator of idelology => Lowest rung, used as a tool by both abby and others to propergate narrative
- Abigale...
  - Passive leader empoweverd by system
  - Originally passive, and simply leading others in small group
  - Enabled by the questioning of Hale and then by the court
- Seeing is presented as the opposite of knowing: that seeing results in someone going mad and becoming absolutely convinced by a false prtense
- Hale is an authority that trusts his learning and intellect beyond all, which means that he wants to impose his depth of knowledge (though not authority) on others; but when his knowledge/reasoning contradict the crowd, he is not afraid to speak out
- Want to analyze the character of Danforth: what is the difference between Danforth and Pudnam/Parris, beyond the name to save. Were they all motivated by authority or is there something fundimentally different?
