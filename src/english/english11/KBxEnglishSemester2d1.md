### I Hear America Singing
BY [WALT WHITMAN (Links to an external site.)](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/walt-whitman)

I hear America singing, the varied carols I hear, < varied, diverse
Those of mechanics, each one singing his as it should be blithe and strong, < "his". as it should be, blithe = carefree
The carpenter singing his as he measures his plank or beam, < singing "his," song is possesive
The mason singing his as he makes ready for work, or leaves off work, < ?
The boatman singing what belongs to him in his boat, the deckhand singing on the steamboat deck, < singing what belongs to him
The shoemaker singing as he sits on his bench, the hatter singing as he stands, < singing "as" 
The wood-cutter’s song, the ploughboy’s on his way in the morning, or at noon intermission or at sundown, < ploughboy = any country boy
The delicious singing of the mother, or of the young wife at work, or of the girl sewing or washing, < "of" 
Each singing what belongs to him or her and to none else, < song is unique
The day what belongs to the day—at night the party of young fellows, robust, friendly, < ?
Singing with open mouths their strong melodious songs.

I, too, sing America. < america is something that can be sung

I am the darker brother. < sick wordplay.
They send me to eat in the kitchen  
When company comes,  < second class? using fundementals like eating? :: bottom of maslow hierarchy
But I laugh,  < overcoming, improving
And eat well,  
And grow strong.

Tomorrow,  < tomorrow! hope!
I'll be at the table  < promise
When company comes.  < period, not comma..
Nobody'll dare  < dare? not about power
Say to me,  
“Eat in the kitchen,”  
Then.

Besides,   
They'll see how beautiful I am  
And be ashamed—

I, too, am America. < nationalist as well? wc

sing vs am
'too' is crucial - ariel



# Theme for English B

[Langston Hughes (Links to an external site.) (Links to an external site.)](https://poets.org/poet/langston-hughes) - 1902-1967

The instructor said, < instructor

_Go home and write_  
_a page tonight._  
_And let that page come out of you—_  
_Then, it will be true._ < generated from someone, then it is true?

I wonder if it's that simple?  < not saying it's wrong? 
I am twenty-two, colored, born in Winston-Salem.  < missing context here
I went to school there, then Durham, then here  <
to this college on the hill above Harlem.  < college "on the hill"
I am the only colored student in my class.  
The steps from the hill lead down into Harlem,  < lead "down"
through a park, then I cross St. Nicholas,  < missing context again
Eighth Avenue, Seventh, and I come to the Y,  < 
the Harlem Branch Y, where I take the elevator  < diverging paths
up to my room, sit down, and write this page: < meta! this must be true

It's not easy to know what is true for you or me   < you or me instead of us? or just, what is true?
at twenty-two, my age. But I guess I'm what   
I feel and see and hear, Harlem, I hear you:  < are experiences
hear you, hear me—we two—you, me, talk on this page.  < ?? in dialogue
(I hear New York, too.) Me—who?  < the question of identity
Well, I like to eat, sleep, drink, and be in love.  < sterotype?
I like to work, read, learn, and understand life.  < contrast
I like a pipe for a Christmas present,  
or records—Bessie, bop, or Bach.  < contrast! all about being split between two worlds
I guess being colored doesn't make me _not_ like  
the same things other folks like who are other races.  < likes **more** 
So will my page be colored that I write? < page embodies the reader

Being me, it will not be white.   < 
But it will be  < 
a part of you, instructor.  
You are white—   
yet a part of me, as I am a part of you.   < intwined culture
That's American.  > interconnedtednes is american
Sometimes perhaps you don't want to be a part of me. 
Nor do I often want to be a part of you.  
But we are, that's true!   < inevitable
As I learn from you,   
I guess you learn from me—   
although you're older—and white—   
and somewhat more free.

This is my page for English B. < trapped in the institution

we all define eachother, and then communal definition is what is american.
this stretches class and race and wants, it's "true"

Will V-Day Be Me-Day Too?

[Langston Hughes (Links to an external site.) (Links to an external site.)](https://poets.org/poet/langston-hughes) - 1902-1967

            Over There,  
            World War II. < not here!

Dear Fellow Americans,  < fellow, also an american
I write this letter  
Hoping times will be better  
When this war  
Is through.  
I'm a Tan-skinned Yank  < def?
Driving a tank.  
I ask, WILL V-DAY  
BE ME-DAY, TOO? < included in the victory?

I wear a U. S. uniform.  
I've done the enemy much harm,  
I've driven back  
The Germans and the Japs,  
From Burma to the Rhine.  
On every battle line,  
I've dropped defeat  
Into the Fascists' laps. < served americans cause

I am a Negro American  < not just a "normal" american
Out to defend my land  < **my** land
Army, Navy, Air Corps—  
I am there.  
I take munitions through,  
I fight—or stevedore, too.  
I face death the same as you do   < fundemental unity
Everywhere. < but death is everywhere. iffy tho, cus so did the other side of the war?

I've seen my buddy lying  
Where he fell.  
I've watched him dying  
I promised him that I would try  
To make our land a land  < land is not literally land, yet
Where his son could be a man—  
And there'd be no Jim Crow birds  
Left in our sky. < nice wordplay

So this is what I want to know:  
When we see Victory's glow,  
Will you still let old Jim Crow  
Hold me back?  
When all those foreign folks who've waited—  
Italians, Chinese, Danes—are liberated.  
Will I still be ill-fated  
Because I'm black?

Here in my own, my native land, 
Will the Jim Crow laws still stand?  
Will Dixie lynch me still  < who? :: confederates
When I return?  
Or will you comrades in arms  
From the factories and the farms,  
Have learned what this war  
Was fought for us to learn? < war was fought for them to learn? because applied to others?

When I take off my uniform,  
Will I be safe from harm—  
Or will you do me  
As the Germans did the Jews?  < drawing similarity to nazis
When I've helped this world to save,  
Shall I still be color's slave?  < slave to color itself?
Or will Victory change  
Your antiquated views?

You can't say I didn't fight  
To smash the Fascists' might.  
You can't say I wasn't with you  
in each battle.  
As a soldier, and a friend.  < friend
When this war comes to an end,  
Will you herd me in a Jim Crow car  
Like cattle?

Or will you stand up like a man  
At home and take your stand  < at home? about democracy?
For Democracy?  < taking a stand for equal rights = a stand for democracy
That's all I ask of you.  
When we lay the guns away  
To celebrate  
Our Victory Day  
WILL V-DAY BE ME-DAY, TOO?  
That's what I want to know.

            Sincerely,  
                GI Joe. < missing context here :: generic soldier
