# passing project!

## rough idea

compare contrast!

- compare: 
	- both have unreliable narrator

lose perspective -> unreliable narrator

"living in the divide"

we are unsure, just like the characters
- contrast: 
	- told you can, but can't :: gatsby, social class
	- told you can't, but can :: passing, race

## outlinin



unreliable narrator

even though, nature is opposite

***

- p1: unreliable narrator
- p2: gatsby social class
- p3: passing race

~thesis?
