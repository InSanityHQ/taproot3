## Writing. F\*ck it.

At the beginning of *Fences* second act, August Wilson uses metaphor to communicate Cory's shift in viewpoint towards his father. The scene begins with Cory pondering his identity with respect to his father's, Troy. Cory, just having been denied by his father to pursue his own dreams, stands at the last shred of evidence of Troy's now broken dreams. He is "at the tree hitting the ball with the bat," engaging in a broken form of baseball -- the representation of his fathers childhood dreams. Cory is not playing baseball, he is merely "hitting the ball with the bat," a shallow imitation of the true game. This imitation is physically attached to "the tree," an embodiment of unnoticeably slow change and growth. The tree's progress seems to stagnate, its growth only apparent when looked for. This pattern of growth reflects the societal progress which Troy is not willing to look for despite his son's pleading. Instead, Troy falls into the illusion of stagnation and tells Cory to quit pursuing his dreams. After hearing this message, Cory's alignment with his father starts to shift: "he tries to mimic TROY, but his swing is awkward, less sure." Cory is making an active, conscious effort to be like his father. He does not simply mimic Troy, but rather he "tries to" mimic Troy. However, he is no longer confident about wanting to be like his father. Instead, he mimics awkwardly, and is "less sure" than his father. Cory has begun his shift into rejecting his father as his role model. The stage directions end with Rose entering "from the house," representing how Rose is an extension of Troys stagnation. Rose then makes a mundane request to Cory, to which he responds "I ain't quitting the team. I don't care what Poppa say." Cory's non sequitur of a response further indicates his state of thought and uncertainty. He is looking to his mother for support 

Just like Troy's outlook on the world, specifically his sons possibility of a career in sports,
