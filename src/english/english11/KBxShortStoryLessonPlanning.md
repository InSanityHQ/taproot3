## notes on the story
- part 1
	- all about how bad and poor living in russia was, and how great it was to come to america

## themes / discussion qs
- america as an idea vs. as a place?


"All the way home the words she read flamed before me: “We go forth all to seek America. And in the seeking we create her. In the quality of our search shall be the nature of the America that we create.”

So all those lonely years of seeking and praying were not in vain! How glad I was that I had not stopped at the husk—a good job—a good living—but pressed on, through the barriers of materialism."

Reflections on Teaching *How I Found America*

While this assignment was an opportunity to do a deep dive into a short story, it was also an opportunity to learn a bit about the process of teaching. One of the things our group grappled with was how to balance telling leanings (teacher generated) versus allowing the finding of leanings (student generated). Relying on student generated content was risky, because we didn't have control over the outcomes, thus running the risk of a flop; we only had one chance — no redoes. However, I believed that if it worked, it would be more effective at teaching and more engaging than the alternatives. So despite the risk, I pushed for a focus on student driven exploration. In the end, we decided to lean towards cultivating an environment for discovery, while trying our best to mitigate risks.

#### The planning
This approach involved:
- An introductory lecture:
	- Showing a lesson outline
		- For transparency and making our segments motivated, so we wouldn't lose students or their engagement along the way
	- Giving relevant background info on the author
	- Giving a plot overview
		- As a refresher on the story, as well as mitigating the impact of students potentially not having read the story
	- Giving relevant historical context 
	- Showing interdisciplinary connections
	- Making sure people knew how to use the tools 
	- A promise of cookies
	
- Providing structure in our collaboration space
	- Picking a subset of the text to focus on (8 passages)
	- Creating guiding questions
		-   How does the idea of America compare to America’s true depiction in the story, and, crucially, how does it compare to your experience?
		-   Thoughts on how the story depicts responsibility? Whether it be to strangers, peers, family members, subordinates, or society. 
		-   What can we learn about community? What about when it interacts with capitalism? 
		-   How does the story depict rebellion, and what are your thoughts on this depiction?
	- Creating big themes
		- American Dream
		- Vehicles of oppression and liberation
		- Mind vs. Body (thoughts vs. hands)
		- Inhumanity of capitalism
	- Encouraging and creating a space for questions and multi-layer deep threads
	- Color coding all of the above to allow for more effective collaboration 
	- Pre-populating the space with some annotations, questions, comments, and replies to help act as a catalyst and demonstrate how to use the space


#### The class
In the end, here is what we made as a class:

I would say, it worked! 
As a concept, the collaboration space did pretty well, especially considering this is the first time any of us has used this technology.

As for engaged students, in the beginning we had some graffiti and such, but after a few minutes that went away and people were annotating, commenting, replying, and connecting between each others ideas.

Here are some examples of the
