Key ideas and terms to think about and discuss:

Second-sight/double-consciousness/twoness
How does it feel to be a problem?

 ```





## the forethought
the "meaning" of being black

- the problem of the 20th century is the problem of the color line
- we get an overview of the book, nice
- he lives within "the Veil"
	- but that is meant to be obvious
	
## i "of our spiritual strivings"
- the question: "how does it feel to be a problem"
	- has ~always been a problem
- shut out from the world of white people by a "vast veil"
	- no desire to tear down the vail, but the contempt faded
	- > "for the words i longed for, and all their dazzling opportunities, were theirs, not mine."
	
- black people are born with a veil and gifted with second-sight
	- can only be seen, by himself or others, thorugh the lens of the "other" world
- twoness, in american and black person
	- warring ideals
	
- the end goal: be both american and black w/o trouble internally or from those around you
- freedom was promised but not achieved by emancipation

[skim]

## the dawn of freedom

- relation of the darker to the lighter races of the men 
- amendentments from the civil war made the modern racial problems
- tale of the "dawm of freedom"
	- deals with the Freedmen's Bureau
	- attemps to grapple witht eh vast problems of race and social condition
