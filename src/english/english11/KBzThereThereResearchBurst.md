# Crucible/Communist Witch Hunts
- In fact meant to be an allegory for the "communist" witch hunts in modern America
	- Still makes use of the historical context of the Salem witch hunts
	- Many of the explanations for the different motivations for a "witch hunt" within the book make a lot more sense when cast under this light
- The secretive nature of the American communist party led to misunderstandings about it's intent
	- Led to a lot of sentiment that it was un-american and threatened democracy
		- This led to the creation of the HUAC (House Un-American Activities Committee) which was composed of members of congress meant to investigate various people for alleged signs of rebellion and disloyalty
- Mccarthy spearheaded legislation to prosecute those with any links to communism or the communist party past or present
	- This created a lot of fear which helped create the circumstances under which this novel was written
		- Arthur Miller himself was Subpoenad, but he managed to avoid it until 3 years after his book premiered
		- He feared prosecution
