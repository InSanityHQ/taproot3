#+TITLE: Civil War
#+AUTHOR: Houjun Liu

* Two Focal Questions and Centering Points
- What /long term conditions/ contributed to the eruption of the Civil War?
- What /short term causes/ ignited armed conflict in 1861

> Is "Uncle-Tom's Cabin" a cause or a reflection of the civil war?

**Nothing in history in /inevitable/**. Its not inevitable that we had the civil war; Lincoln could have let the South seceded. 

* Conditions of War

** Geography
- Land and Climate
- Natural Resources
- Rivers & Coast

The North has worse geography, so they have diverse income and economics. The South has better geography, but then their economy is less diversified (focused on cotton, tobacco, sugar, etc.) Indigo was also an incredible crop in the south.

** Economic Development
- Northern states had lumber and trade => industrialization
- South had slave labor

** Demographics
- European Immigration is more popular in the North
- South's has heavy reliance on slave labor

** Slavery
- 3/5 Compromise
- Missouri Compromise
- Abolition Movement

*** Abolition
- Fugitive Slave Laws
- Emancipation: what to do with slaves? Do we free them into society
- Repatriation? The US created Liberia to send people back?

*** Uncle Tom's Cabin
Becomes best seller + heavily censored in the south

** Western Expansion
- Louisiana Purchase => leads into sentiments of manifest Destiny
- Missouri Compromise
- Mexican-American
- Kansas + Nebraska had mini civil-war over slavery

** Technological Changes
Industrial Revolution + Cotton 'Gin (1793).

** John Brown Raid
**John Brown* + his allies, including 5 African Americans capture federal arsenal at Harper's Ferry, VA.

** Elections
Lincoln swings the election, and wins the electoral college

** Ford Sumter
Ford Sumter protected the coastline, confederates creating a blockade by cutting off its supply. This marks the real beginning of the civil war.

"Nothing is inevitable until here."

* What If?
- **What if** Abe Lincoln fallen short of the electoral majority
- **What if** the north allowed the South to secede
- **What if** England and France had become more involved in the Civil War
- **What if** the South had survived the war intact
