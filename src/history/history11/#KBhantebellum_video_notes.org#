* Guiding Question
- In what respects was American discovery of technology used to rationalize inherent American superiority (sui generis) as a people?
- What social and political conditions in America allowed the proliferation of the discovery and implementation of technology in the antebellum period?

* Argument
**American technologeThis , instead of being an accidental process that naturally helped propegate American-centrism, is actually a calculated attempt for growth and serves as a by-product of American Expansionism in the antebellum period.**

** The development of American technology was not much of an accident
[[id:C1872F3C-A92E-4567-8EA2-B38C2BA0CF3D][Technology, and the **smuggling** thereof, created the basis of American tech scene.]] The process of value production, unlike that pictured in American popular culture --- which is one of celebrating the grassroots sense of [[id:7780EB45-5664-4A10-B373-828528D49986][people in their victory]] --- actually [[id:3CA1A1D2-E5FB-4C94-9DBF-92B22DEE8E8F][fairly devoid of intellectual independence]]. 

** The Pace of the early patents set up animocity between inventors and scientists
Patent office was designed such that it originally granted all patents. When proponents
[[id:5349F775-DD9E-4B0E-8C0B-18005591C44E][attempted to consider the originality of patents]] instead of allowing the rapid pace of development, [[id:BA3ADFD9-C263-4761-A6E6-7AA5110EBE97][Congress is painted as the villan of inventors as they were sluggish to act to improve upon the patent office]], which really came [[id:EAA7907C-D132-44F2-9EBC-FA3E57A2747E][an argument]] between the inventor/technologists --- who wants their inventors protected --- and the scientific man --- who wants to grantee the uniqueness and scientific rigur of patnets. This is directly in antethisis to the spirit and energy of early antebellum, where [[id:32CFCDB4-58A1-4909-97A8-17301827FF15][the conditions allowed the  implentation of new ideas and change]] rapidly: a result of [[id:4BC7EA89-7695-482B-827A-A44DB6C82FB3][the idea of the universal "advancement"]].

** Pace of Development is Visible!

*** The telegram rapidly increased the pace of development in America (Telegram would spark Action)
A now-fundamental part of America --- parties --- is developed through the telegraph: [[id:7867065E-9D0F-4B79-8B70-4A2843F63219][policitical parties could not be possible w/o the telegraph]]. According to one newspaper right before the war, the [[id:CA83170B-BA34-4BF4-B13C-8AF14FDEBF7D][the Telegraph is an the agent of action]]. 

*** Transportation, Communication, and the Economy
As part of the increased route network, the building of new tech. (roads) created [[id:1A3A8BF8-21E8-4C77-A298-DD9F40CCD272][an economic proliferation.]] The creation of road networks also [[id:152B7D7B-592F-47FD-9EC2-51428C1E80D5][shifted American perspective towards the West]], proliferating the country westwards. [[id:8980BA8F-3388-4071-A2B8-D5575999E433][The Telegraph as the deliverance of political news]]: purported to be very fast and delivers "factual?" information.

** ...because they were avoiding a fundimental fear

*** The (slow) pace of pre-telegraph communication actually made America possible (Telegram would spark Inaction)
[[id:89D78CA8-0BC1-4C85-8D5D-06A16FA1302C][Speed of communication caused unessesary damage --- that even after rev. technicially ended people are still fighting.]] This lead-time actually caused the formation of the revolution in the first place, that [[id:4427B3FE-EB1C-46E9-945B-B5D4305DC104][the cause of the American revolution may have not happened were communicatio be more rapid]].
