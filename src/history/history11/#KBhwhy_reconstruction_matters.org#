* Reconstruction Reading
- People + Things
  - Johnson vetoed many of the civil rights acts
  - More republicans being elected --- increased radicalism actually lowered productivity
  - Thaddeus Stevens + Charles Sumner's land redistribution acts got killed
- Were + When
  - Post Lincoln Assassination
  - In the South

Why significant? Ideologically-driven divide and the solidification of management bloques still exists and is quite prominent today.
