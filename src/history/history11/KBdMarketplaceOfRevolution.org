#+TITLE: Marketplace of Revolution Notes
#+AUTHOR:Dylan Wallace


* Reading notes
- Why did the revolution happen when it did?
  - "Consumer revolution"
- Marketplace of Revolution: Consumers were able to identify with each other through shared experience of consuming goods (Thesis)
  - No other protest revolved around boycotting imports

- American mobilization happened, but was not expected
  - Pownall: American mental horizons were too narrow for them ever to cooperate with those who happened to live in other provinces
  - But it happened anyways
- America used to be fairly fractured
  - Boston people didn't want/expect aid from outside Mass.
- However stamp act induced people to protest, which brought them together (?)


- Colonists linked consumer goods to politics
  - "Tale of the Hospitable Consumer" anthology
    - America => bad England relations?
    - American buying habits => imperial crisis?
      - Caused by facetitious wealth caused by 7yw
- Shift from consumer to farmer? p13
- more historiography
- Consumer protest
  - Non-importation to oppose Stamp Act
  - Townshend acts opposition
    - Lost momentum after repeal
  - Tea Act
    - Largest protest
  - Boycott central to American Revolution
  - "boycotts worked so effectively because they linked two separate eighteenth-century revolutions, one economic and the other political"
  - mid 18th century - reliance on British goods as shared sense of identity
  - late 18th century - Americans politicized common consumer goods and invested items with new symbolic meaning
- Social stuff and forcing boycotts yadda yadda yadda
  - forged political identities?
  - villified non-protestors?

- Franklin in House of Commons
  - Franklin shits on British, ties politics to imported goods
  - Franklin fashion passage
    - Americans don't care about English fashion and clothing anymore bc politics
- Even before franklin imported goods were political
- Depression in 1764 - impact
  - Post-war trade stagnation
  - Threatened loss of improvements in standard of living by ancestors
  - Didn't immediately translate into organized protest but drew attention to consumer spending decisions
  - Saving money => condemning self-indulgence -> patriotism

* Summary so far
- We should look at individual consumer choices as a driver of the revolution
  - Boycotting British goods => Political leverage
  - This was done through societal forces/factors
