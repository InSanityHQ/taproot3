* A Bad, Brief Timeline of the Revolution
American Colonial History:

** 1760 - French and Indian War, cont'd
[[file:KBhFrenchAndIndian.org][French and Indian War]] sparked a series of hissyfits against each other between Britian and Colonists.

- Proclamation Line: responses and boycotts
- Definition of "patriots"/"loyalists" changes

** 1770s - The Revolution

*** 1775: Common Sense/Plain Truth
Common Sense vs. Plain Truth published, declared against each other.

*** 1776: Independence Declared
This is a largely plagiarized document, but nevertheless declared independence.

*** 1777: Articles of Confederation
The "13 states" formed, leveraging the Articles of Confederation.

*** 1787: Constitution
The previous one sucked, so we do it better.

* A Longer, Better Timeline

** The Revolution Starts (not declared war in 1775)
In this time, there are three different groups with different lenses:

- Patriots: want to declare revolution
- Apathetic: don't want to fight
- Loyalists: want to save the British

*** 1775: organized army
Created 2nd continental congresses, Washinton hired privateers (licensed pirates) to fire at enemy shipts.

*** 1775@quebec
American forced invaded Quebec, but that was terrible because they took no account of the weather and failed.

*** Winter 1775
The American Revolution Starts, but its not officially declared

- Boycotts forced Government Shutdown
- Sent the Olive Branch partition to ask for amnesty
- **Declared the colonies in rebellion**

** Propaganda about War Starts: 1776
Declare Independence: want to get French Support

*** Commons Sense
- French began supplyling gunpower

*** New Warfare
- Regional Militia: took cover and shot at smaller regions
- Used surprised attacks

*** British Defeats
- It was not certain that Revolution was successful

*** Christmas 1776
Crossing the Delaware almost causes lost war.

- Washinton and attacked the Hessian during Christmas
- Gamble paid off, crossed tho Delaware and capture their material
- Had everything that needed to survive from the Hessian

This defeat was big for propaganda purposes, **boosted morale** and raised confidence.

** Turning Point: 1777
- Defeated British in Open Warfare
- French declared public support

Battle of Saratoga

** Paris Peace Treaty, 1783
Signed peace treaty and declared full success

* Wait but /How/? 
- British was apathetic
- Americans was on home turf (British through ocean, random cause)
  - Had French support
  - Washinton stood strong and consistent
  - Luck!

Ok so now what?

- Fighting under the "Articles of Confederation": not really united
- Constitution not written until later
