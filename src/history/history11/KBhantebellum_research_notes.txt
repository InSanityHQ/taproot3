Research notes: the Antebellum.


1 Guiding Question
==================

  - In what respects was American discovery of technology used to
    rationalize inherent American superiority (sui generis) as a people?
  - What social and political conditions in America allowed the
    proliferation of the discovery and implementation of technology in
    the antebellum period?


2 Howe - What Hath God Wrought
==============================

2.1 The speed of communication increased the speed of production
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  American farmers and planters—and most Americans then earned a living
  through agriculture—increasingly produced food and fiber for distant
  markets.


2.2 The telegraph served as the intergrater and a pusher for manifest destiny
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  The electric telegraph then helped integrate this continental empire.


2.3 That the telegraph is also an invention of "God", and therefore a justification for Manifest Destiny
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  As Morse later commented, the message "baptized the American Telegraph
  with the name of its author": God.


2.4 That the telegraph is something used to justify and expedite America and Christianity's influence upon the world
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  This noble invention is to be the means of extending civilization,
  republicanism, and Christianity over the earth. It must and will be
  extended to nations half-civilized, and hence to those now savage and
  barbarous.


2.5 Policitical parties could not be possible w/o the telegraph  :claim:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  However, no such parties with mass followings could have come into
  existence without the revolution in communication.


2.6 The early national period allowed the implentation of new ideas and change
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  The early national period witnessed now and controversial ideas being
  formulated, publicized, and even in many cases implemented.


2.7 "Modern" tech propergated the spread of novel ideas          :claim:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  All such reforms were created, discussed, and propagated through the
  enormously expanded media of print and wire.


2.8 Speed of communication caused unessesary damage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  A severe winter all Europe, these were large armies for North
  America. transportation over the Atlantic world slowed communication
  and made transportation difficult. Neither army knew that across the
  ocean, representatives of their respective countries had signed a
  treaty of peace eight days earlier.


2.9 Earlier sentiments of irish racism also prevails
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Perhaps Mullins’s suspicions were justified: Because his troops were
  Irish, they might have been thought expendable.


2.10 Descrimination runs deep and compensation thereof was and still is used a political device
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Besides twenty-four dollars cash, each soldier was supposed to receive
  160 acres of public land, but forty years later, the black veterans
  were still trying to get their land claims honored.


2.11 The cause of the American revolution may have not happened were communicatio be more rapid
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  When Congress declared war on Great Britain, June 18, 1812, its
  members did not know that two days earlier Foreign Secretary
  Castlereagh had announced in Parliament that the Orders in Council
  restricting American commerce would be suspended.


2.12 Americans did not celebrate technology but instead people in their victory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Neither did they celebrate the technological know-how that enabled
  their artillery to perform so well. Instead the public seized upon the
  notion that western riflemen, untrained but sharp-eyes, had defeated
  the arrogant British.


2.13 It also manifested a failure to foresee how much the future of the United States would owe to mechanization and government- sponsored enterprises like the federal armories that made cannons.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


2.14 Much of the society is extolling the /people/ instead of the technology --- with the latter often being the driving force behind success
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  It also manifested a failure to foresee how much the future of the
  United States would owe to mechanization and government-sponsored
  enterprises like the federal armories that made cannons.


2.15 Technology represented a type of federalism (government sponsored technological development), instead of the success of the "husbandmen" individuals coming to fight.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


3 Factories: Lowell
===================

3.1 Lowell factory organisation caused the formation of organized labor groups
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  In the 1830s, the factory owners lowered wages and the Lowell workers
  went on strike in 1834 and 1836 (though unsuccessfully), making them
  one of the first organized labor groups in the U.S


3.2 Wages in factories were very low, and never raised despite the healthy benefits
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  who ever heard, of such a thing as their being raised again,” says the
  first speaker. “I confess that I never did, so long as I’ve worked in
  the mill, and that’s been these ten years.”


3.3 That there is very little time for consumption
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  The reason why, is because you are a rational, intelligent, thinking
  being, and ought to know enough to swallow your food whole; whereas a
  horse or an ox, or any other dumb beast knows no better than to spend
  an hour in the useless process of mastication.


3.4 Factories allow for those without social standing to work and be not a burden to society
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Namely, the many who have no home, and who come here to seek, in this
  busy, bustling “City of Spindles,” a competency that shall enable them
  in after life, to live without being a burden to society


3.5 Conditions were brutal physically and emotionally
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  There are many things we do not like; many occurrences that send the
  warm blood mantling to the cheek when they must be borne in silence,
  and many harsh words and acts that are not called for.


3.6 that there is very little intellectual independence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  besides the clothing and feeding of the body is to be thought of; when
  the mind is to be clothed and fed


3.7 That the promise of high wages are not delivered by the factory system
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  the practice of sending agents through the country to decoy girls away
  from their homes with the promise of high wages; when the market is
  already stocked to overflowing


3.8 worker health is not protected, either
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  even then if the mind is enriched and stored with useful knowledge, it
  must be at the expense of health


3.9 Parts of factor life considered "pleasant"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  pleasant associations connected with factory life


4 YAWP Market Revolution
========================

4.1 That the idea of "advancement" is a universal concept in America
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  what one Baltimore paper in 1815 called an “almost universal ambition
  to get forward”


4.2 Forces of the industrial revolution remade the nation and powered new developments while sparking the market revolution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Steam power, the technology that moved steamboats and railroads,
  fueled the rise of American industry by powering mills and sparking
  new national transportation networks. A “market revolution” remade the
  nation.


4.3 Technology-driven market revolution drove vast commercialization and shifting away from self-sufficiency
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  More and more farmers grew crops for profit, not
  self-sufficiency. Vast factories and cities arose in the
  North. Enormous fortunes materialized.

  ... ironic, because self-sufficiency was the original goal


4.4 Technology, by proxy, accelerates slavery?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  As northern textile factories boomed, the demand for southern cotton
  swelled, and American slavery accelerated


4.5 Transportation revolution allowed vast public advancement to the West (<>manifest destiny?)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  The so-called Transportation Revolution opened the vast lands west of
  the Appalachian Mountains.


4.6 The proliferation of technology directly lead to the improvements of expansion and eentually globalization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  If a transportation revolution began with improved road networks, it
  soon incorporated even greater improvements in the ways people and
  goods moved across the landscape


4.7 Technological proliferation lead to economic proliferation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  The ensuing web of rail, roads, and canals meant that few farmers in
  the Northeast or Midwest had trouble getting goods to urban markets.


4.8 As a part of transportation rev., there was also communication rev which revolutionized transferrance of info
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Such internal improvements not only spread goods, they spread
  information. The transportation revolution was followed by a
  communications revolution. The telegraph redefined the limits of human
  communication.


4.9 The expansion of communication and transportation allowed the spread and nationalization of the market economy + expanded opportunities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  They earned cash for what they had previously consumed; they purchased
  the goods they had previously made or gone without. Market-based
  farmers soon accessed credit through eastern banks, which provided
  them with the opportunity to expand their enterprise but left also
  them prone before the risk of catastrophic failure wrought by distant
  market forces.


4.10 Technology shifted the American perspective towards the West
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  The development of steam power and the exploitation of Pennsylvania
  coalfields shifted the locus of American manufacturing. By the 1830s,
  for instance, New England was losing its competitive advantage to the
  West.


5 Antebellum Patents
====================

5.1 American Patent System was reformed as an act of necessity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Because so many applications seemed bereft of any originality, Keller
  had begun unofficially "advising applicants as to the novelty or want
  of novelty in their inventions."8 Eventually he sat down and worked
  out a formal plan for procedural reform


5.2 That the industry of patent litigation owes itself to the stringentness of Keller
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  This low initial patent-to-application (p/a) ratio was as much
  attributable to improperly prepared applications as to any marked
  "illiberal" streak in Keller.


5.3 The expertise actually needed in the American Science was controvertial in early congress
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Debate focused primarily on the question of h much expertise an
  examinership actually necessitated, with Cogressmen Andrew Johnson and
  Robert Toombs leading a move to trim the raise


5.4 Conflict between scientific and industry prevails in the process of patent rejectinos
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  In order to guarantee inventors "a fair and candid examination and
  decision there should be a special board to review all rejected
  application board with majority control vested in "thorough bred
  mechanics."


6 Primary Source
================

6.1 Boston Courier: The Telegraph as The deliverance of political news
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Every word here wirtten is true, and it is long in advance of even the
  telegraph, which gives it additional value.

  Boston Courier, 12/31/1860

  <file:2021-11-06_17-04-12_screenshot.png>


6.2 Albany Evening Journal: The Telegraph, in phrasing, is referred to as the agent of action
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  The telegraph communicates the following. It is too absurd for
  credence.

  Albany Evening Journal, 12/31/1860.
