#+title: Fauner's Lincoln's View of Slavery
#+author: Houjun Liu

A summary of Will Rush...

Lincoln carried some abolitionist values but never aligned himselve in anti-slavey party.

- Lincoln is anti-abolition was originally not a morality point, but instead wanted to just stick to America's founding creed
- Lincoln was "pushed" through the abolitionist/emancipatory stance
- Lincoln downplayed slavery to not think it was degrading to them

He was trying to better the economy by abolishing slavery. Not too much critiques of the work --- dismanting complicated figures who get glorified and oversimplified by history. that ---

"these characters from history are human beings, and that they changes with the context with their time". We have a tendency to villify and deify
