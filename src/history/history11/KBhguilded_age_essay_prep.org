* Claim Synthesis

** Sub-Claim Organization

*** There is only one thing different about the Gilded age: tech

- We never noticed this b/c [[id:C21A781E-8EC5-45BC-BC7F-11DB410D07B8][historians fail to specialize in business, tech, or politics, which then create the negative term]].

*** Technology boomed in the Gilded age, which actually created the basis of discontent
- [[id:DF5B17DD-CBC6-410A-87D8-00A888A6E97A][Skyscraper technology also caused financial and corporate boom]].
- [[id:E798EE2C-3DC0-44EF-AF32-11FBBC952534][Oil drilling advancement created boom in industry, and created the opportunity for businessmen]].
- Hard pursuit of technology was something that created the basis for agitation: [[id:83723888-C66F-40F1-9646-103A1307849F][that child workers are shut away from the "civilized" qualities of the world]].

** The Claim
Despite the classical, social-centered analysis of the late 19th-century America which labeled the time period the "Gilded Age", it was actually the discovery of novel technology at the time that shaped the modern Republic and brought the sociopolitical change which is typically associated as identifying markers of the time.


# - technology and how it serves to shape the modern republic

# it was the discovery of novel technology drove---a as corollary---the sociopolitical changes of the time; as such, it would be more appropriate to name the period "Age of Tech-public": where the Republic itself is beginning to be shaped by Technology.
