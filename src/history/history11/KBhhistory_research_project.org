* Proposal
- **Topic**: I am working on the American-Japanese economic sanctions that lead up to WWII
- **Question**: What Japanese political strategies (both geopolitical and economic) were deployed in response to American economic sanctions (e.g. American oil embargo, etc.) in response to Japanese belligerence, and did the responses contribute to or diffuse the tension that ultimately resulted in the attack on Pearl Harbor? 
- **Significance**: I am perusing this study so I can help others understand the utility of hard-line economic sanctions as a tool of response to geopolitical conflict.
