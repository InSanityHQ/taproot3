* Proposal
- **Topic**: I am working on the American-Japanese economic sanctions that lead up to WWII
- **Question**: What Japanese political strategies (both geopolitical and economic) were deployed in response to American economic sanctions (e.g. American oil embargo, etc.) in response to Japanese belligerence, and did the responses contribute to or diffuse the tension that ultimately resulted in the attack on Pearl Harbor? 
- **Significance**: I am perusing this study so I can help others understand the utility of hard-line economic sanctions as a tool of response to geopolitical conflict.

* The Claim
The oil embargo against Japan, a brash action that directly lead to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, was perceived by the US as inevitable and strategically undemanding due to a failure to recognize the foreign Japanese spirit of "Bushido" expansionism.

While the United States treated its oil embargo as a platform on which diplomacy can be built, the Japanese perceived the action as confirming the beginning of an inevitable---and proactive---attack upon Japan by America.
