:PROPERTIES:
:NOTER_PAGE: (4 . 0.3753581661891117)
:END:
This gigantic step in the growth of the American republic was not taken with enthusiasm by either president or Congress, but resulted from the fact that the elements in opposition could find no viable alternative and no basis on which they could combine.

** The force of manifest destiny threatened the union itself
:PROPERTIES:
:NOTER_PAGE: (9 . 0.12607449856733524)
:END:
Much of the national harmony had rested upon the existence of a kind of balance between the northern and southern parts of the United States. The decision to fight the war had disturbed this balance, and the acquisition of a new empire which each section desired to dominate endangered the balance further.

(Mexican-American war was the instigator of the revolotuion)

"Perhaps it may even be said that the developments which gave American nationalism the strength to survive also generated a supreme threat to its survival ."

assailing the expansionist plans of the administration, suggesting that the ulterior purpose was to extend the area of slavery

:END:
Ever since the days when Martin Van Buren had jockeyed to displace John C. Calhoun the favor of Andrew Jackson

** :claim: Sectionality and politics are two different things, they become conflated != they are the same
:PROPERTIES:
:NOTER_PAGE: (6 . 0.2946708463949843)
:END:
it is well to recognize that sectionalism was not initially or intrinsically a political phenomenon, and it is important to consider sectionalism in its prepolitical form

:PROPERTIES:
:NOTER_PAGE: (7 . 0.274294670846395)
:END:
The two cultures still would have clashed even if all the Negroes had been free.

:PROPERTIES:
:NOTER_PAGE: (8 . 0.09717868338557993)
:END:
The outstanding weakness of this cultural interpretation is that exaggerates the points of diversity between North and South, mini mizes the similarities, and leaves out of account all the commonalities and shared values of the two sections which have been discussed in the preceding chapter.
** Differences in production augmented differences in philosophy

:PROPERTIES:
:NOTER_PAGE: (11 . 0.3824451410658307)

** Each section painted a strawman of the other to react to
:PROPERTIES:
:NOTER_PAGE: (13 . 0.3072100313479624)
:END:
As they became isolated, instead of reacting to each other as they were in actuality, each reacted to a distorted mental image of the other
** :claim: That the sectionalization and painting of strawman actually cause further discord w.r.t. being blinded to similarities
:PROPERTIES:

:END:
extremely threatening to the tranquillity of the northern mind
** When Mexico war took place, the careful Northern seperation was disturbed
