═══════════════

1.1 :claim: Japan sohuld not have bombed peral harbor
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Japan’s decision to bomb Pearl Harbor was a blunder of the highest
  order


1.2 :claim Biggest trigger of American war invollvement was the decision to invade indochina (Laus, etc.)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Perhaps the greatest misstep was the July 2, 1941, decision to invade
  southern Indochina.


1.3 Economic self-sufficiency became a major goal of Japan after WWI
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  A group of Japanese officers observing events in postwar Germany
  became obsessed with the importance of gaining economic autarky,
  including self-sufficiency through conquest.


1.4 Japan and China conflict set the stage for western bitterness
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Japanese victories at Nanking, Xuzhou, Hankou, Guangzhou, Wuchang, and
  Hanyang did not fully suppress Chinese nationalist armies, and bitter
  fighting persisted.


1.5 :claim: American support of China in Sino-Japanese conflict was because that they were "agast by the atrocities"
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Aghast by Japanese atrocities, America provided material assistance to
  the Republic of China.


1.6 US at the time had a weak army, yet strengthened its navy + moved it to Hawaii
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Japanese officials interpreted the growth and shift of U.S. sea power
  as a threat to its own sea control, trade, national well-being, and
  strategy.


1.7 America's first response, after Sept. 1940 attacks in Northern Indochina, was to implement embargo on parts for warmaking
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  That same month the United States halted its exports of scrap iron,
  steel, and aviation fuel to Japan on the grounds that it was needed at
  home. The embargo also extended to arms, ammunition, critical raw
  materials, aircraft parts,


1.8 By Jan 1941, denial of war materials grew to create big dent in Japanese industry
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  January of 1941, the denial of war material was extended to copper,
  brass, bronze, zinc, nickel, and potash, causing a major impact on
  Japanese industry


1.9 Japanese pact to get resources and military with Germany + Italy meant to deter the US,  but actually was viewed as an aggression
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  While Japan hoped that this would deter the United States,13 in fact
  it compounded the affect of Japan’s occupation of northern Indochina
  and was taken in Washington as a move to counter American opposition
  to Japanese expansionism.


1.10 Japan attempted to remain neutral, even given the pact, come Germany <> Soviet invasion
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Despite German pressure, Japan maintained its neutrality with Russia
  and continued its move to the south.


1.11 :claim: At the point of German <> Soviet invasion, the relationship between Japan and other world powers began to be shaped
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Japan thus began to shape its relationships with the major powers for
  a coming confrontation with the United States.


1.12 :claim: that, because incorrect implementation, peace deals
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  While their intentions were good, a thorough review of the episode by
  the historian R. J. C. Butow concludes that in fact they created con-
  fusion by misleading both sides with regard to the origins of various
  peace proposals.


1.13 :claim: that the japanese creation of the co-prosperity sphere both ruptured Japanese-American relations and also remove its alliances
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Under this decision, Japan would not attack the Soviet Union despite
  pressure to do so from Germany; Japan would not abrogate the
  Tripartite Pact with Germany; and Japan would secure control over all
  of Indochina militarily.


1.14 Japanese home minister warned against war with US, but Imperial Conference rejected it
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  The home minister, Kiichiro Hiranuma, warned that war with the United
  States should be avoided at all cost, but the Imperial Conference
  rejected the warnings.


1.15 :claim: Japan was taken by surprise of the second round of American embargo despite their first round
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  There was no serious examination in Tokyo of the possibility of
  imposition of a total embargo by the United States, Britain, and the
  Netherlands. They were taken by surprise.


1.16 France gave up the ports in southern Indochina, and so despite Roosevelt's warnings, Japan invaded
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  With the door to the rest of Indochina now opened by France,
  Roosevelt’s warnings not to walk into that open door were disregarded


1.17 And so Ameria froze Japanese assets. Notably, however, no oil embargo
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  In response, the United States first froze all Japanese financial
  assets in the United States. But an oil embargo was postponed.


1.18 Another intepretation of roosevelt's decision caused oil embargo (so… technical error?)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  In August 1941, Acheson interpreted Roosevelt’s earlier decision
  strictly and took steps to impose what amounted to a de facto oil
  embargo on Japan by canceling Japan’s ability to pay for the oil


1.19 Ambivalence to tech error lead to oil embargo
──────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Roosevelt did not object.


1.20 The Japanese government was cut off from its econ source, and was shocked
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  The cumulative impact of sanctions severely stressed the Japanese
  economy. Despite the clear warning, the Japanese government professed
  surprise and shock that the Americans would react this harshly


1.21 Security by obscurity made the Japanese foreign office seem deceptive
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  intelligence made Nomura appear deceptive


1.22 :claim: revisionist history claims that Roosevelt meant to trigger war to proxy Germany
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Revisionist historians have questioned Roosevelt’s motives during the
  second half of 1941, arguing that he boxed Tokyo in by giving them no
  choice


1.23 That the attack on Pearl harbor was an escalation given
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  which were either national economic suffocation or surrender of
  Tokyo’s empire on the Asian mainland.


1.24 Japan had to either concede or eventually fight
────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  force massive concessions from the Dutch East Indies would lead either
  to a confrontation with the United States or to a conciliatory
  strategy by Japan.


1.25 After the embargo, japanese navy persued war
─────────────────────────────────────────────────

  After the occupation of southern Indochina and the imposition of the
  U.S. oil embargo, the Japanese navy shifted ground from its earlier
  opposition to war.


1.26 To make a policy, Japan's navy and army had to agree, but navy is less belligerent
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Military leaders fell into factions: The navy was generally less
  belligerent than its army counterparts. Both groups were needed for a
  policy consensus, so the navy had an effective veto.


1.27 Japanese suffered from cultural ignorance of America
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  They carried an aggressive Bushido spirit and suffered from what
  Barbara Tuchman called “cultural ignorance.”


1.28 Tokyo had a strategic peace deadline, which was passed
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  An emissary, Saburo Kurusu, was sent to Washington in a final effort
  to negotiate peace, but his efforts fell short as Tokyo’s deadline
  approached


1.29 Diplomacy failed because it required Japanese to conceal
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  The first was the diplomatic path. Bluster had failed. To be
  successful on this path, Tokyo would have to reverse course and end
  its occupation of Indochina…And by then, diplomatic channels were
  clogged with distrust.


1.30 Maintaining US neutrality and attacking Britian failed because…. they didn't think of it?
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Tokyo could proceed with an attack on Dutch and British possessions
  but spare Pearl Harbor and the Philippines…But the option was not
  given serious consideration. It remains unclear how the United States
  would have responded


1.31 Or, just go for overtake and ignore other countries and hope US tires itself
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Tokyo could follow the advice of Yamamoto to strike deeply at the
  enemy’s heart and hope that the United States would tire of war


1.32 Japan didn't declar war, and just went for it
──────────────────────────────────────────────────

  The attack took place before Japan could formally declare war,
  creating the “day of infamy.” America instantly took a war
  footing. Six months later, at Midway, Japan sought to finish off the
  American carriers.


1.33 Spirit and culture distorted japanese view of ar
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  The information they had was filtered through a prism of militarism,
  extreme nationalism, arrogance, the urge to conform, a pull toward
  groupthink, and do-or-die spirit.


1.34 :claim: Therefore, American sactions were not going to be effective
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  To this military-dominated culture, sanctions were not reasons to
  change policies; sanctions were hurdles to overcome. Diplomatic
  concessions were viewed as weak and a sign of flawed character.


1.35 Japanese intervention saw as not liberating but invading
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  The Chinese saw the Japanese as invaders, not liberators. The
  resulting atrocities set American opinion strongly against Japan and
  produced a hardening of U.S. policy, including sanctions.


1.36 :claim: Japanese believed that the US millitary was weak
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Japanese leaders appreciated that the American economy was much
  stronger than theirs and that over time America’s military could
  dominate theirs. But they took a short-term view, believing that a
  quick victory could solidify their control in Southeast Asia,


1.37 Japanese surprised by US oil embargo
─────────────────────────────────────────

  Despite warnings from Nomura, which they tended to ignore or discount,
  the leadership in Tokyo seemed surprised by the American decision to
  implement an oil embargo


1.38 The benefits of a Japanese surprise attack was short
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Japan was right about the importance of the U.S. Navy to America’s
  military capabilities in Asia. But the benefit from surprise can be
  short-lived. Hitler’s surprise attack on the Soviet Union grounded to
  a halt just as Tokyo launched its attack on Hawaii.


1.39 :claim: Japanese ambition were the main hinderance
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  The Japanese leaders were, in Tuchman’s words, “prisoners of their
  outsized ambitions.”


1.40 :claim: American time pressure worsened Japanese
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Time pressure, including limited oil supplies, swung the navy in favor
  of military action. Its assessment that war might be short was flawed.


1.41 :claim: Underestimation of America is the principle
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  The fundamental flaw in the Japanese model of reality that lead to
  Pearl Harbor was underestimation of America—its willingness to take a
  tough diplomatic stand, its ability to recover from attack and
  respond, and its willpower.
