#+title: Owen's Emancipation Strategy
#+author: Houjun Liu

- Emancipation was not a completely an ideological move
- The emancipation proclamation was helpful to winning the war

  As the union was not winning the war, he issued the emancipation proclamation --- Black people are able to fight and take up labour positions.

  12% of the union army were eventually Black solders: emancipation was a warmaking measure designed to leverage the southern sentiment --- the slaves in the south was loosing manpower to control peace to keep slaves in check. Owens was putting his part and his electability in a lot of danger.

  That emancipation was not through the legal system and instead was a strategy.
