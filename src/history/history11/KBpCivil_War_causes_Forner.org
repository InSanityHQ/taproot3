** Notes:
- Immigrants tended to live with other immigrants from the same country
- they did not try to culturally assimilate
- there was a decent amount of cultural mixing
- Irish "cluster" together in ghettos, they become a target of anti immigrant sentiment
- The idea of being "Irish" was something that came with immigration
  - there were many different places in the territory known as Ireland, that didn't really have anything to do with each other except for geographical location.
  - with migration these immigrants were clumped with people from the same place, but not necessessarily the same background
- In these ghettos there is a increase in crime and disease, the immigrants living in the ghetto get blamed for it
- Immigrants saved money
