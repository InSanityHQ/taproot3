* Introduction
- Freedom and liberty are fundamental to Americans' identity
- Freedom and liberty are often used interchangeably
- Freedom and liberty (fal) are often looked back as a constant definition that did not change throughout history, but Forner thinks that the definition that changed (link to history is a series of arguments)
- This reading will focus on the definition of fal throughout the civil war

* "We All Declare for Liberty"
- Abraham Lincoln: "We all declare for liberty...but in using the same word we do not all mean the same thing"
  - the north saw freedom as everyone enjoying the products of their labor
  - the south saw freedom as the power to do as they please with other men, as well as their products of labor
- The North winning the Civil War changed the definition of freedom to the northern meaning
- The Civil War changed the idea of the power of the American Government:
  - The Gov got more power, but it was the power to "create positive social change"
  - it went from northeners not liking the gov because it supported slavery to liking the gov because it abolished slavery
- Civil War was a fight for slavery as well as the country --> a fight for less state rights and more power in the central gov because states rights was a more pro slavery stance
- North triumph meant new definition of freedom as well as a new nation coming out of the war that would be built on this idea of new freedom

* What is Freedom?
- After the war the notion of freedom became a hot topic of debate because that would define what would happen to enslaved peoples
- thus control of the definition was also a hot topic
- Through this lens, the definition of freedom post civil war was not some static definition, but rather a "battle ground" for debate
- there were three different "definitions" of freedom:
  - the one of the former slaves
  - the one of the Southern whites
  - the one of the Republican North
