- There was the dunning school which was quite racist and taught that the southerners were fighting for states rights, bascially framed the south as the hero of the civil war and reconstruction and then framed the north as the villian
- then comes along Du Bois who refutes this narrative by writing that the racist literauter is a result of the dunning school not being able to see African Americans as people
- In the 1960s people started to revise the history around the education of the civil war and the reconstruction to frame it in a more accurate and "radical" way. Showing both the progress and the fallbacks interms of civil rights and not puting the African American in the role of the villian
- Talk on how there was not much change during the reconstructions and how there continued to be institutions in the south, that were quite similar to slavery
- reconstruction is ongoing and we are still correcting the institutions for hundreds of years back
- it is a process not a time period
