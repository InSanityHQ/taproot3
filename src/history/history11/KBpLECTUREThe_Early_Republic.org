* Ratification
- 9 out of the 13 states need to agree to the American Constitution
- This is where the Federalist and the anti-federalists comes into play
  - Role of the national Government?
    does the government have too much power?
  - bill of rights?
    freedom of speech, right to bear arms...
    if we list rights and forget on then that gives the legal justification to do something bad, but at the same time if we don't protect peoples right's the government can just do what it wants, the comprimise is the amendment system

* The New Government
- George Washington is the first president
  - Two terms
  - appointed cabinet
  - enforcing law suppression
- first supreme court, with 6 members
- Hamilton's Financial Program
  - Elimination of federal debt
  - First National Bank, divisive
    - national currency
    - national bank needs to take on the debt of the states
    - wanted to grow the country
  - Compromise with Jefferson & Madison to move capital to D.C.
    - DC in the south, so it is in slave country, easier to continue slavery

* Agrarianism
- the American farmer is the backbone of the society
- southern identity
- farmer is the idea of liberty

* Impact of the French Revolution and Haitian Revolution
** French revolution believed in freedom, liberty, justice...(similar to Americans), but they reject religion in order to praise feedom and liberty.
 - so there is kind of a debate on this
 - allows Jefferson to say that Hamilton is in favor of a monarchy --> leads to political separation and the creation of classes
** Hatian revolution
 - spurred French to abolish slavery throughout colonies
 - caused fear of slave revolt in the US, US citizens doubled down on slave "oppression"

* the rise of political parties
