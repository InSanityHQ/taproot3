* Technological improvements during the antebellum era
- The telegraph
  - long range communication
- printing and paper manufacturing
  - more newspapers, magazines and books
- the expansion of the postal service, as a product of more newspapers and like readings
- Steam boats, canals, turnpikes, railroads
  - lower shipping costs, faster travel time

* the telegraph
- had a wide spread impact
- was used to spread the word of god, as well as other messages
- A symbol of how religion and science really went hand in hand at the time "What hath God wrought" being the first message sent with the telegraph
- helped with the formation of political ideas, along with developments in newspaper technology


* Jacksonian democracy
- author does not like the term because Jackson was controversial
- There were also a lot of human rights abuses during this time period:
  - "The /consequences/ of white male democracy, rather than its /achievement/,shaped the political life of this period" (5).

* Market revolution
- Author also avoids this term, because the expansion of the market was a product of stable growth and not sudden "revolutionary" growth.
- the author rather describe the time period as a revolutionary expansion of communication, and thus calls it the "communication revolution"
  
* main point of the reading:
- the invention of the telegraph meant better communication
- better communication meant ideas could spread faster
- This had economic, religious, political and cultural impacts
- one example of this is the spreading of anti slavery opinions, which increased tensions between slave and non slave states
