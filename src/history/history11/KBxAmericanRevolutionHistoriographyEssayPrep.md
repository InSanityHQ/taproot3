American Revolution Historiography Essay

In a paper approximately 4 pages in length, write a synthesis essay using at least two of the American revolution articles. The goal of the paper is to write about the historiography of the American revolution, synthesizing different interpretations to make your own argument about the causes of the American revolution. 

Synthesis writing is not that much different from what you did in 10th grade where you incorporated multiple sources while answering questions posed in the prompt. You are not summarizing the texts, comparing/contrasting, or making a judgement about how one source stacks up against another. Instead, you are using the sources to develop and advance your own idea about the revolution. 

Your synthesis might take one of two general tracks (though I am open to discussing additional ideas as well):

1.  Historiography: How might the sources help us to think about how histories of the revolution are told. You might think about the types of arguments the authors are making: do they construct a top-down or bottom-up narrative? Do they highlight political, economic, cultural, or ideological factors in their explanation of the events leading up to the revolution? What are the implications of these organizational and analytical decisions? Your paper might resemble a “state of the field” highlighting the insights and lingering questions from our accumulative understanding of the revolution. You might also highlight what is “at stake” in these arguments about the revolution
    
2.  Historical synthesis: Using the evidence and insights from the authors, what kinds of conclusions might you draw about the revolution. You might look at different causal forces to talk about the radical potential or radical results of the revolution (or lack thereof). You might develop connections between the different analytical perspectives offered by the authors--for example, how might we look at ideological roots, elite anxiety, and popular participation as being constituent parts of a larger whole? Does the revolution represent an advancement in democracy or a continuation of elite rule? What sort of ideas, fears, and interests do the authors point to in describing the motivations of the different actors involved in the revolution?
    

To assemble the material for your essay, you should feel free to utilize your notes from the presentations of other readings, consult with your classmates, and/or read parts of the other readings while preparing your essay. While your thesis should of course be your own original work, it is always a good idea to talk about your ideas with others, including your classmates.

what was the cause of the american revoltion?

thinking:

historians that we read think about causality wrong

proximal and distal causality?

infinite chain of causality


cause -> cause -> effect

multiple causes can lead to multiple effects which in turn have effects

there is no single cause! it fits into this graph-network of causes and effects

essay: fit the causes of the american revolution into this graph framework of cause -> effect
 
for example, being able to unite over shared rejection of goods might be a proximal cause, but it is not *the* cause of the revolution.
 
big idea: **NEW MODEL OF CAUSALITY** 
this is, historiography.

models of causality are based on 



historians look for causes.

causes historians find


the concept of the cause of the american revolution has evolved 

perceived cause has co-evolved with changes in the view of causality itself -- it has gone from theological causality, to modernistic causality, postmodernistic


**the frameworks in which we situate causes have evolved just as the assigned causes themselves have changed.
we can understand these frameworks -- how they have shifted, and even where they should go -- by looking at them from a higher level of abstraction: the evolving view of causality itself.**

## Writing. Begin.

Grappling with causality is inherent in the historical analysis process. This process is predicated on the concept of cause and effect; constructed histories take an effect, assign a cause, then explain the connection between them. Even with a single effect, say, the American revolution, these histories take many different forms and evolve as time goes on. They have shifted from arguments involving divine right, through the "great men" narrative, and into economic and cultural explanations. These are all assigned causes to the American revolution, the evolution of which is a history in and of itself. However, just as these assigned causes evolve over time, the frameworks these causes reside in have coevolved. The very way we think about causality has changed, allowing us to ask and consider new questions which are only allowed to emerge in certain frameworks of causality. We can understand these frameworks -- how they have shifted, what their limits are, and even where they should go -- by looking at them from a higher level of abstraction: the evolving view of causality itself.

One of the first frameworks took the form of theological causality, a framework which most modern historians reject. This framework's causes stem from the divine: god caused the American revolution to happen, and we should not try to understand it. The modern historian Breen points to this framework as something that should be avoided in his 2004 book *The Marketplace of Revolution*. The histories emerging from this framework assign the cause of the American revolution to "a kind of divine blessing defying close analysis" (Breen 8). The flavor of divinity is irrelevant; what matters is that the divinity of the cause leads to the conclusion that we should not try to understand. If we were to attempt analysis, we would simply be defied. This framework is evident from primary sources at the time of the American revolution -- the Declaration of Independence itself starts by referencing the powers that "Nature's God entitle them." The Declaration continues, writing that our "unalienable Rights," what the Declaration claims to be the purpose for fighting, are "endowed by their Creator." It ends writing of a "firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence" (US 1776). The ideals supposedly driving the revolution are given by the divine, and the success of the revolution stems from divine providence. While this version of the American revolution focuses very clearly on god as the divine, versions claiming that the revolution stemmed from sheer luck also fall into this framework, where the concept of god is simply substituted. Within this framework of theological causality, the questions of what caused the revolution and what we can learn from the revolution don't make sense -- they arn't allowed. Instead, the question of what the wishes of the divine are and how one pleases god dominate.



The framework of theological causality then evolved into the framework of modernistic causality, what most modern day histories reside in. The histories within the framework of modernistic causality each pick a cause, then claim that this cause led to the American revolution and therefore lets us understand the revolution. Modernistic causality is cause-agnostic -- all that it requires is the claim that given the "true cause" we can understand the revolution. The actual causes each history assigns to the revolution within this framework vary drastically, from social to economic factors. For instance, historians like Gordon Wood argue that the American revolution should truly be understood through social change. Wood argues that even though the radicals who led the revolution "talked in what seems to be only political terms," they were really communicating what was "a decidedly social message." Wood continues, stating that "one class did overthrow another [...]. But social relationships [...] were changed, and decisively so" (Wood 5-6). Wood delegates the economic motivations of the powerful to the realm of unimportance, and instead argues that social factors and unity through values drove the revolution. While Wood doesn't claim that other factors don't exist, he argues that his cause is the true cause -- through the analysis of social factors, he argues, the revolution can truly be understood. Contrasting Wood, in his book *Forced Founders*, Holton places focus on economic factors of the revolution. He argues that the revolution was "led by land speculators" and driven by the "so loathed [...] Navigation acts" (Holton 22 & 31). Despite these contrasting supposed causes, both Wood and Holton fall into the framework of modernistic causality. They both claim to present a true cause, and posit that the revolution can be understood through analysis of this true cause. This framework allows for the question: what was the true cause? The question of how one pleases god, however, doesn't make sense within this framework.
	
%%The modernistic causality framework is distinct from the theological causality framework..%%

The next logical step from modernistic causality is postmodernistic causality, which argues that cause itself is a flawed concept and we cannot understand effect. This framework rejects the very notion of "true cause." Postmodernistic causality doesn't allow any questions to be asked, as it posits that no lessons can be learned. Postmodernistic causality claims that the revolution cannot be understood, while modernistic causality claims that it can be understood, and theological causality claims that we should not try to understand it. From such a vast array of perspectives in the modernistic and theological causality frameworks, the postmodernistic rejection of "true cause" seems valid -- we will never be able to truly understand the causes of the American revolution. However, in this rejection, postmodernistic causality also rejects any learning we can gain from the past. This rejection of possible learning is where the framework of transcendent-modernism differs.


Transcendent-modernist causality is a theoretical framework one step past postmodernist causality. While postmodernist causality rejects modernists causality's concept of true cause, transcendent-modernist causality rejects the need for a true cause. Transcendent-modernist causality acknowledges the unsolvability of the problem of history, but posits that we can still learn from history regardless. This framework doesn't operate on a single cause, as modernist causality does, but rather situates causes into a graph structure. One such graph structure generated from a handful of modernist causality perspectives could look as such:

{THE GRAPH}

Each cause is represented as the effect of another cause, and is therefore aligned from most proximal to most distal. The granularity of such a graph can be increased, where each connection would be substituted with a set of cause-effect links. Inherent in this representation is the acknowledgement of its limits -- granularity can always be increased to move closer to reality. However, such a graph doesn't limit us to picking a single cause, and instead lets us acknowledge our limits and analyze the interactions between causes at arbitrary granularity. It focuses on what we can learn rather than a true cause. This transcendent-modernist causality framework could be where historical analysis should shift.
