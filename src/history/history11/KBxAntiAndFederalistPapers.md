# Federalist 10: Madison
[the reading.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gTBc8LchBtaDVANwIpdMQAybLBAMzrr5B5wF40BvgNE/edit)
### faction
- methods of "curing the mischiefs of faction"
	- remove the cause
		- destroing the liberty which u need for it's existence (ban it)
		- get rid of the faction by making everyones opionions of it the same
	- control its effects

- first one is really bad! worse than the disease

```ad-qoute
Liberty is to faction, what air is to fire, an aliment,[1] without which it instantly expires.
```

- cant get rid of liberty to get rid of faction
	- it's like getting rid of air to get rid of fire
- second method is impracticle as the first is unwise

- causes of faction are sown in the nature of man!
	- faction leads to bad things 
		- mutual animosity, not cooperation for common good
	- this happens all the time, but the most common place, is **unequal distribution of property**
- those w/ prop and those w/o prop have distinct interests

```ad-important
regulating these contradictory interests is the job of legislation
```

- faction is less than majority than it can be defeated via majority vote

- pure democracy doesnt work! 
	- it falls to the mischiefs of faction
- instead, we use, a **republic**


### republic

- it can cure!
- points of difference:
	- delegation of government 
	- extendability?
	
-  few elected people are less liekly to sacrifice ideals for temporary considerations
-  better voice for public good than the voice of the public themselves
	-  but they can betray!
	
-  less people, less parties, more same party elected, can lead to oppression
	-  so we need more people?

# Federalist 51: Madison
#extract
- about controlling the abuses of government

```ad-qoute
If men were angels, no government would be necessary. If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary.
```

- **the** dichotemy: a goverment needs to control the governed, and the governed need to control the goverment
- not just about guarding the people against the opression of the rulers, but guarding one faction of the rulers against another faction of the rulers
- we need, a **will indipendant of the society itself**
- larger the sphere, the more capable of self-government it will be
	- hmm. larger the sphere, the more emergent props u get?


# The Centinel

- make sure to consider before you give up your personal liberites
- my reading comphrehension is drastically failing me.

- argues, federliast government is bad! 
	- it doesnt have the essential requistes of a free government 
	- instead, it is the most "daring attempt to stablish a despotit aristocracy among freemen, that the world has every witnessed."
