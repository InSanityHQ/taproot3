# Federalist: Madison

- methods of "curing the mischiefs of faction"
	- remove the cause
		- destroing the liberty which u need for it's existence (ban it)
		- get rid of the faction by making everyones opionions of it the same
	- control its effects

- first one is really bad! worse than the disease

```ad-qoute
Liberty is to faction, what air is to fire, an aliment,[1] without which it instantly expires.
```

- cant get rid of liberty to get rid of faction
	- it's like getting rid of air to get rid of fire
- second method is impracticle as the first is unwise
