## Give earth a chance notes
- doesn't like the current history on the environmental movement in the 60's
- *** 
- jump 
- ***
- the root of a lot of concern was the radiation testing:
	- 'americans could not trust their own milk' because of the radioactive fallout contaminating the dairy pastures
	- there from the beginning!
- hey, also a mention @sputnik [[KBxResearchProjectPlanningPtTwo]]!
	- shook the sense of comfort that american's had, about war but also about the environment
- pollution was thought of as a big deal after this time period
	- push towards socialism 
	- hatred towards cities
	- possible primary source: *Life* presidential interview in 1960
- johnson agenda in the wake of the new deal
- great society also had a focus on the environment 
- The League of Woman Voters also played a big role
	- lobbied against nuclear *weapons*
		- need to remember that much of the sentiment toward NW is what led to and allowed the sentiment toward NE
	- "Pure Milk [...] Not Poison"
	- very similar sentiment as towards pesticides
- this is all about nuclear weapons, not energy..
