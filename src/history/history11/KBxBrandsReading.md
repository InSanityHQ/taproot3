# Brands!

- a text like the declaration of indipendance in the sense of the influence it exerted over the american populace
	- wealth of nations, adam smith
- (WoN -> capatalism) = (DoI -> democracry)
	- natural law vs. self interest
- ofc, takes time to grow
	- america is where they have grown best, forming the archetypal **democratic democracy**
- > "yet the dual manifestos of 1776 were also dueling manifestos."
	- argues, democracy depends on euqality, whereas capitalism depends on inequality
		- uh...
- inequality is a nessesity for capatalism, not merely a byproduct
- tension between democracy and capatalism -> characterized america
- argues, andrew jackson embodied democracy
- but capatalism fought back in the civil war
- money: the philosiphers stone of modern capitalism
	- so morgan was important!
		- created the capitalist revolution?
- effects:
	- courts reinterpeted the constituion in capitalisms favor
	- created inequality
- > "by the century's end the imperatives of capitalism mattered more to the daily existence of most americans than the principles of democracy."
	- the capitalisnts had immense power, more so than the law makers
