## live notes

Thoreau as the origin :: 
Thoreau → [Gandhi → Mandela] → King

- rebels against the gov, 
	- about duty.

nonviolence, etc, all goes back to Thoreau

1877 reconstruction was aborted
resurgence of racism, KKK, etc
- birth of "separate but equal" fallacy

also the ideological conflict about how to move forward like discussed in [[KBxWEBDuBois]], and jackie robinson as discussed in [[KBxFencesBaseball]]

1950s end of separate but equal w/ rosa parks
- super hard to actully get to work, as not many other options for transport

next comes the civil right movement in the middle of the cold war climate
- led to people trying "to paint king 'red'" ie. make him look like a communist

1960 election brought about a massive medium shift
- first televised debates!
	- nixon looked bad (sweaty ect.)
	- but kennedy wore makeup, and looked young and strong and ect. 
		- made a huge difference, and example of technological shift changing the landscape

significant amount of domestic terriorism, media was important 


> "the function of a civil resister is to provoke a response" *-Gandhi*

'accepting the firehose' as the model for how to resist.

voting rights act gets passed 1965

malcolm x was also super important 
assasinated..

whole bunch of assasinations actully

1990s we get rodney king and etc. 

seeds to all kinds of other movements
