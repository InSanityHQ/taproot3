# civil. war! 

[the assignment.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f--SwDtZbowaAzG9AnEM6uOeixDN8Amryy9eHQ4hrD8/edit)

> looking at the story of the leadup to the war

- inevitability: not a historical question?
- we are looking for: 
	- the thread!
	- frameworks of:
		- long term
		- short term
		- social
		- economic
		- (cause)


### a video!
- we are starting in 1850, middle of 19th century
- end of slavery is emphasized
- then we look at reconstruction, the era after the civil war
- as well as the legacy of slavery and abolition
end, intro.
- this guy wrote a bunch of books
- reconstruction **era**
	- raised still v relevent questions
	- what is the def of freedom and equality?
		- force vs. consent in social change
		- what are the rights of the individual vs. security?
	- who is an american?
	- what do we need to do to get racial equality
	- terrorism? "homegrown" 
- **civil war era issues are still prominent!**

```ad-tip
- what historians say has a practical impact, not just about some abstract debate
```

- second reconstruction, civil rights movement
	- view of hist had "direct, practical, bearing"

back to tom


```ad-def
title: presantism
 uncritical adherence to present-day attitudes, especially the tendency to interpret past events in terms of modern values and concepts.
 ```

modern day exploration is inherently shaped by the *needs* of the present
> and that's just good history -tom

the charge: be curious! what are the questions you have? pursue them!

## the project!

w/ @exr0n!!!!!! :)))) !!! wuuu

```ad-abstract
- Causes of the Civil War visualization 
	- Using some sort of visual organization (i.e. a flow chart), identify and track the major causal forces leading to the civil war. For this assignment the goal is less to single out one specific cause as the most prominent cause but instead to highlight the way different causal forces (economic, social, political, etcâ€¦) intersect with each other. You might also think about long term, structural causes (economic, demographic, social changes) and short term causes (policy decisions, key events, legal decisions) to present your image of the path to war.
		- Will cover Content and Knowledge standards, argument, and use of evidence (optional) standards
```


something cool with threejs or blender.
