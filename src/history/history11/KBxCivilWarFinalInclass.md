> looking at the story of the leadup to the war

- inevitability: not a historical question?
- we are looking for: 
	- the thread!
	- frameworks of:
		- long term
		- short term
		- social
		- economic
		- (cause)


### a video!
- we are starting in 1850, middle of 19th century
- end of slavery is emphasized
- then we look at reconstruction, the era after the civil war
- as well as the legacy of slavery and abolition
end, intro.
- this guy wrote a bunch of books
- reconstruction **era**
	- raised still v relevent questions
	- what is the def of freedom and equality?
		- force vs. consent in social change
		- what are the rights of the individual vs. security?
	- who is an american?
	- what do we need to do to get racial equality
	- terrorism? "homegrown" 
- **civil war era issues are still prominent!**

```ad-tip
- what historians say has a practical impact, not just about some abstract debate
```

- second reconstruction, civil rights movement
	- view of hist had "direct, practical, bearing"
