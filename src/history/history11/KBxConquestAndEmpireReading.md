- as american imperialism increased, so did imigration into the US
	- imerpailism and immigration both raised the questions of 
		- who was american 
		- what is america role in foreign enviroments
		
**american intervention**

- first unincorporate territories of the US were the guano islands
	- precedent for future acquisitions
	
- "interventionist attitude"

- intervention w/ Huerta in mexico
	- justified by potential bearing on the united states
	- not true for intervention in the middle east!
	
- > Should the United States act as an empire? 
	- > Or were foreign interventions and the taking of territory antithetical to its founding democratic ideals? 
	- > What exactly would be the relationship between the United States and its territories? 
	- > And could colonial subjects be successfully and safely incorporated into the body politic as American citizens?
- one view, america had a "duty to discharge" around the world
- american anti imperialist league with lots of big names started
	- idea was to protect the rights of self-governance for everyone
	
- "big stick" was what roosevelt wanted
	- but wasnt actully good enough, so instead people used "dollary displomacy" to assert dominance
	
- oof.. roosevelt and friends :: "manly duty" of the US to intervent and spread its superiority 
- dollay diplomacy was cheaper than military and didnt require a military
	- also, gave oppurtunties to bankers
		- strapped for cash leaders took out massive loans w/ insane interest rates

- "turnover in regimes interfered with the repayment of loans" jesus christ
- immigration was a big thing,
	- people were worried that so much immigration would be bad 
	- so they added lot's of restrictions
	- and viewed immigrants as inferior

- battlship, Maine, exploded
	- lots of people died
	- during a period of tension w/ spain
	- people thought it was the spaniards
		- bam! war. (ten days later, officially)
- ofc, the Maine was only the proximal cause
	- but maybe not? many view the sinking of the Maine to be the main cause 
	- or simply, made an avoidable war inevitable
		- ended all hope for peace
- another interpretation, the explosian made war acceptable to the general public, even if not inevitable
	- the concept of inevitability itself bothers me in this context.. what does it even mean?
	- and also, ofc, the argument that this shift in public viewpoint made it inevitable
		- heavy linkage from public opinion and the war!
			- doesnt need to be rational, and thus, doesnt need to be explained
- "the unthinking American masses"
	- "spontaneuous emotional reaction to a random incident"

but, this linkage has problems!

- were people outraged instantly? or were they only outraged after people "determined" the explosion to be done by the spaniards?
	- diff evidence for each!
	- wait this is the big argument? really? why do we care?
	
- verification is not possible for most of this stuff
- some say that the country forced the gov into war after the Maine
- the president was forced into war by the populace and congress
	- some people think he couldnt have avoided the war, despite his best efforts
	- other disagree (wow)
		- they say he wasnt strong enough, and was week-kneed. spineless, ect.
		
**what is this reading??** christ.

- maybe it was about the yellow press
	- the fault of the irresponsible press
	
- after the Maine, the cuban question dominated public consciousness	

- almost **every explanation of the war has the Maine at its center.**

- the war was not a failure of american diplomacy
	- it was despite american diplomacy
	- cus american people wanted the war

- portrayed as caused by: accident, spanish "medievalism," or the masses

*lmao tf? nice reading bro.*
