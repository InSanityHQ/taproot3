### outlinin?

people used to revear the president
no longer the case — "all a bunch of crooks"
why?
answer: watergate

what actully happened during watergate 



- rise in investigative journalism
	- became a path to career success




- politicians used to be revered
- people nowadays don't trust politicians
- why?

of course, i have since realized that the answer to this question is multifaceted and much too complex for me to holistically answer, but as I set out to answer it, one thing just kept coming up.
one scandal that has since defined the rest. one event which stood out as a major turning point — and as i researched more about what actually happened, a lot of the modern day outlooks on politics started to make a lot more sense to me.

of course, i'm talking about watergate.

so what was watergate? and how did it have **such** a huge impact?
