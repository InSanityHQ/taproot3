# it's (was) growin!
- strength in numbers
	- that's what the labor movement needed to leverage for success

## what's changing?
- industrialization, labor
- where people live
	- goin @ u, urbanization and social group!
- change for labor groups
	- distinction between different immigrant groups fade away 
		- as class inside the massive inequality becomes the defining barriers

- we also have **middle management**
	- but really, the biggest layer is the laboring group
		- one of which, is children!
			- massive amount of supply of worker, so wages start going down
			- and also child labor is valuable because children can 
				- fit in small places, step on things without breaking it, etc.
				
- because of this issue of child labor, people pushed for investing in **child labor**
- and also, galley labor
	- crazy amount of exploitation!

## labor unrest

labor unrest is either in northern **industrial cities** or **along the railroads**
which makes a lot of sense, as the railroads were the "lifeblood"
specialization!

- capitalists also hired personal muscle
	- the Pinkerton detectives, for example
- management vs. labor was a big deal

```ad-def
title: scab
The term “scab” is a highly derogatory and “fighting word” most frequently used to refer to people who continue to work when trade unionists go on strike action. - *google*
```

- lot's of tools of management
	- blacklisting, breaking up strikes, etc
	
- likewise, tools of laborers
	- boycotts,
	- strikes, etc.
	- use **numbers**

one of the ways they did this was the **knights of labor** like in [[KBxCapatalismAndIndustrialization#the labor movement]]

AFL, another union,  only cared about the *skilled* laborers
had a strike fund! 

## international context
marixism is coming to rise in europe
socialism is rising in US
which ofc becomes the antichrist of capatalism

about grouping and demonizing: haymarket vs negotiation
