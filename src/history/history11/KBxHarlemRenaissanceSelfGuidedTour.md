From what I've seen, it seems like the Harlem Renaissance was a sort of Cambrian explosion of art. However, it wasn't just art that rapidly developed, but also the acceptance of this art in popular culture. 

From what I've seen, it seems like the Harlem Renaissance was a sort of Cambrian explosion of art. The massive diversity I've seen in the works of artists such as Langston Hughes, Wallace Thurman, Jean Toomer, and Zora Neale Hurston is just astonishing. However, it wasn't just art that rapidly developed, but also the acceptance of this art in popular culture. This style and hipness of this art led to many minorities being able to express themselves, in spite of the racial prejudice at the time. The diversity in artwork began to reflect the diversity in culture that America prides itself for. Art allowed for the ethnic minorities to be accepted, whereas without this art, America might have continued in its exclusive way for many more years. However, much of the artwork I've seen is still frighteningly relevant today -- Langston Hughes and Nella Larsen's works still shed applicable commentary on modern day society. They express the racial prejudices, sexual differences, and cultural clashing that still adds to todays social injustices. Despite the passing of nearly a century, there are symbols and situations in Langston Hughes writings that still have strong resonance today.
