	- all these challenges:
		- local jealousies, 
		- mutual ignorance, 
		- fear,
		- clashing identities,
		- etc.

- the question: how did colonists overcome all of this so they could organize around a political vision with strangers over a huge disconnected territory


- what it's not:
	- people were just morally superior
		- freedom-lovers guided by greats model
