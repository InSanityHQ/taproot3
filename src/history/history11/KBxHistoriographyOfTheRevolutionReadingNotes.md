# Historiography Of The Revolution Reading Notes

Our reading: [_The Marketplace of Revolution_](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hz2ifFd6SO508MVg4554ML2X193WCX4o/view?usp=sharing)

- agues: the american revolution should be remebered as a small event?
	- the revolution was mismath between the strongest military power and some normal subjects
		- ideological passions blinded them to "harsher realities"
- wonder: how did colonists overcome local jealousies and mutual ignorance, fear, clashing indentities, such that leaders of the revolution could speak to strangers over a huge territory about a political vision

```ad-important
don't take popular mobilization for granted!
```


- comtemporaies marvel at the level of solidarity 
	- freedom-loving people being guided by great leaders, etc.
- truly extraordinary, as people say
	- mobilization was very risky!
- this reading: explains popular mobilization not from the "peoples good character" perspective, but from....


### imagined community?
- language of shared experiences
	- radically inclusive strucutres of rsistance
	- creating an imagines national community
		- unanticipated at the start of the crisis!
- had to learn to trust eachother
	- mutual education -> trust

```ad-qoute
people transalated personal sacrifice into revolutionary idealogy.
```

- beginning with idealogy leads to discounting social conditions
	- revolutionares stood to lose the most! how were they energized?
- pragmatic arguement about studying hist.. if we raise these revolutionaries to heroes with moral superiority, then it doesn't have much significance to us
	- uh, ok. very cool.
- **we have our own ability to transform political society through collective imagination**

### the marketplace

- it changed!
- **consumer revolution**
	- happened in the middle of the 18th century
		- imports were polittixized
		- shared range of good allowed common ground to communicate about common experience
			- THIS what was gave the colonists the shared experience, which provided the *cultural resources* required to start the protests
```ad-qoute
goods became the foundation of trust
```

- invented the consumer boycott
	- first instance? I doubt that frankly
- boycott movement let people normally not allowed to be involed in politics to voice opinons? to participate
	- generated an entire new form of politics
	- woman and poor had surge of empowerment
- tom highlights: egalitarian potential of this earlier movement
	- even though once they got independence the leaders were like "actully,"
- non-importers allowed american people to reinvent the entire polivitical culture
```ad-summary
"revolutionary politics of pursuing happiness"
```


## tale of the hospitable consumer: a revolutionary argument
*how shared consumer experience faciliated new forms of collective political action* ~tom

- imagined national community as response to oppression
- argues: we should avoid the "discorvery of common cause" argument,
	- because it's about some divine luck that defys close analysis? that doesnt mean we should avoid it, but ok.
	
- stopping for now, quarter way through page 8
***
- continuing!

```ad-qoute
for which we would choose to live, or dare to die.
```

- everyone had narrow-evolded world views in their own communities?
- "invention of identity" collective act of self-discovery that happened over a decade of troubles with great britain

- the sugar act: seemed so bad that it defies explanation
	- ie. how tf?
- colonies beleived that britain was wallowing in welth and luxery
	- which they were
- wait, no.. BRITAIN believed that the colonies were wallowing in luxery
- end of page ten.

- britain had 'gross' misrepresentations of american culture
- benjamin franklin was angry.

- baldwin argues:
	- economic leveling in colonies stimulated status competiotion
		- this competition was primarily done through consumer goods, bought from britain.
		- this was how they sorted in an open society?
		- people must "make a show" more than they do in england, says baldwin 
		
- the narrative goes:
	- england send the best of the best soldiers and welthy sons over,
	- colonies displayed riches to try and impress that were our of the leuge of reality
	- soldiers went back and informed well-connect friends in england about the "affluent consmers" in the colonies.
	
- this was why the parliment taxed the collonies in the first place! that's the point.
	- this was what made the sugar tax and etc seem resanable to the in-debt england.
	
- imbued goods with symbolic meaning
- subscription rolls
	- allowed for recoriding of the popular will
	- people ineligable to vote in the actual system were allowed in the rolls
	- the number of people on these rolls allowed them to say "we speak for the people"

```ad-qoute
the spirit of nationalism was as much a cause as a result of revolution
```

## strength out of Dependence: strategies of consumer resistance in an empire of goods


- imported goods provide powerful political leverage 
- franklin argued that all the imported good were not nessasay
	- didnt need em or could make themselves
	
- colonies willing to forgo the 'luxery' of fashion was a bold concept
	- used to be the pride to indulge in the fashions manguactered by great britain
	- changed to wear old cloathes over and over until they can make new ones themselves
- they repealed the stamp act! franklin had a large part in it, and was regonized as such.

- not easy to give up all these nicitites!
- rhetoric of "save your money and you will save your country"

- stamp act shattered the shared british identity
- end, pg 34
