# The Stamp Act Crisis
- things were not easy to accomplish?
- stamp act set off a crisis
- masachusetts was a good example offf
	- where a political standoff which inhibited rpotest was broken then intensified conflict
- smt in massachusets during 1765 
	- the political division produces paralysis as opposed to the normal violence


### the sons of liberty

aka. the loyal nine.
they wanted to do violence 
didnt have people with high status

got the mob to not like the stamp act
killed some people, made some symbols

coudnt really get rid of em, they didnt listen to the authority at all

### stamp act repealed! 

"no taxation without representation"


- idea of property:
	- personal possesions, or more conceptuals: rights, freedoms, equality, ect
	- draws parreles about possesion 
- ?????? this reading is all over the place
