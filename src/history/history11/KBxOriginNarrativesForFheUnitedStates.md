title: Prompt
**Origin narratives for the United States**

The telling of American history has become one of the focal points of conflicts over our national culture, particularly the relationship between ideas of American exceptionalism and stories of race and conquest in US history. Cowie, for example, highlights the pragmatic value of a shared national story as the basis for any progressive action. What is the value of a shared national narrative and what dangers does crafting such a narrative present? Why does the telling of US history generate such controversy?

In a 2-3 page, double spaced essay, evaluate how the authors we’ve read so far approach the telling of American history and make an argument for what you see as the key considerations in constructing a narrative of American history. Historical narratives, by their nature, are created through choices of what to include and what not, what to emphasize and what to relegate to the margins. In making your argument, include an explicit engagement with the sources we’ve worked with so far. You might, for example, engage with the controversy over the 1619 project and Hughes’s appeal for a “better anti-racism” or with Dunbar-Ortiz’s criticism of multiculturalism. You are also free to use the colonial sources and Morgan reading for material to ground your larger arguments into a suggestion for how to frame the early years of American colonialism.

### more planning

can;t have one simple narrative


narratives: events filtered by framework, turned into a story



value strucutrs, project narratives onto them
america good: america ended slavery, we should be the heroes!
vs.
america bad: america was built on slavery and sin


**the narravisation process:**

values
narrative strucutre
events

filter events on values
fit into narrative structure

narrative absorbed into populace
changes/creates -- perpuates --  populaces values



there is no complete narrative -- 
what should the narrative be? one of many.

narratives are true but not complete

narratives do not need to be complete to be true
to have truth?


narratives incomplete 
incomplete truths revealed
narrvitization process 


rough outline:

- narravisation process
	- values filter events
		- distortive!
	- events fit into narrative structure
		- distoritve!
	- narrative creates values 
		- creates disorted/incomplete values!
	- big point:
		- narratives are inherently distorted/incomplete

- narrativisation
- america good
- america bad
- both have truth
	- we should look to multiple narratives
		- embrace the truth in each even when they conflict
- conclusion
	- we have to live with multiple narratives in conflict 

thesis: narratives are inherently distorting, and thus we must not operate under a singular narrative
