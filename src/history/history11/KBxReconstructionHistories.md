# Differing viewpoints of reconstruction 
and its teaching.

## The Undoing of Reconstruction
*1901*

- geogia entitled to representation in congress
	- supposed marker of the end of recontstruction
	
- argues that even while the north won the war, institutations that would replace slavery were already being instantiated
	- respectable white men, who didnt like the kkk, also didnt like the idea of dealing with the kkk with a black militia
	- gov was 'paralyzed' under its own authority
	- apearance of a armed body of black men didnt sit well with body of armed whites
	
## black reconstruction
*1935*
> **I am going to tell this story as though Negroes were ordinary human beings, realizing that this attitude will from the first seriously curtail my audienceâ€¦.**

damn.


- lots of propoganda to discredit the humanity of black people

- argues that the facts of american hist have been falsified because people were ashamed
- classic narrative at the time was 
	- that the abolitionists ruined any chance at a peiceful resolution
	- black people profited w/o effort
- ofc, not true.
-  south was painted as a martyr to inescapable fate
-  says that the entire field was twisted

## a peoples history of the united states
*1980*
- argues that
	- the civil war was not about ending slavery
	- instead, it was about retaining enormous national territyor and resources
	- the other stuff was just to rally people behind?
	
- says that kkk was organized by southern white oligarchy
	- only a "matter of time" before "blacks would be reduced one again to conditions not far from slavery"
- 14th ammendment gets changed to only apply to states not individuals
- people stopped caring as much about defening black citizens
	- 1870s

## a history of the american people
*1997*

- republican extremists arguing similar things to the secessionisnts
	- that balances gov was impossible
- even though black people were the majority of voters and held all the postions of power, the real power was in the hands of the northern 'carpetbaggers'
- a society based on racial hatred emerged

## letters from an american
*2021*

- BBBB, build back better bill
- "the professors are the enemy" -nixon
	- says that educators are destroying america by not teaching critical race theory??
	
- intresting, argues that attacking profressors are kindling for authoritatian attacks
	- happened in cambodia, itally, and soviet union
- using cultural attacks to consolidate power
- 'souther whites' sayed they were discrimination based on preperty ownership or education
-  says that modern day people are trying to do the same thing and restrict the vote
	-  and we can't let that happen!
