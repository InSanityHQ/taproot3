## thoughts

sputnik? 
- satellite was launched before, sent this massive wave of panic 
	- because the red was ahead technologically! 
	- led to a huge amount of focus on STEM
- turns out, we actully had the satellites the whole time 
	- but eisenhower didnt want to launch them because he didnt want to deal with the fuss about how to manage airspace?






eisenhower didnt want to launch 
- didnt want to escalate?
	- was already spying, and got found out


// this entire philosiphy that

the current modern philosiphhy that science and technology should be the main focus of education was built off of a politically self-serving lie.
the current modern philosiphy -> 
the current educational emphasis on sciene and technolgy, expanded in the post-sputnik era, was built on...

***

- sputnik was a thing 
- sputnik was a lie (we weren't really behind)
- that lie was politically motivated
- and yet...
- sputnik led to an expansion of techno education and social value 
- that persists



politlca self serving motivates what is perceived as true
has this on both sides: eisenhower and the "the gap"

driving 'truths' are formed from politically self serving lies

the sputnik lie -- and its consequent impacts -- 

--[]-- a cultural impact so deep, that the falsehood of its roots has little effect on its adherence -- was propogated by aligned political agendas of competing parties 


thesis:
the Sputnik lie -- {} having a cultural impact so deep, that the falsehood of its roots has little effect on its adherence --  was 

The Sputnik lie, born of political agendas, had a cultural impact so deep that

THESIS: 
The Sputnik lie, and with it massive cultural impacts, was born of a confluence of competing political interests.

- Sputnik had a massive cultural impact
	- hysteria, fear, massive focus on STEM in schools
	
- But it was a lie
	- what actually happened was...
	
- It was a lie because
	- Eisenhower's reasoning (declassified)
		- wanted covert info on Russians
		-  got caught 
		- didn't want to escalate further
	- Dems reasoning
		- wanted to make the reps look bad (had lost previous election due to being portrayed as "soft on communism" - lost China etc..
		
- conclusion?
	- But nobody questions the emphasis on STEM, even though the original premise has been falsified. Thus, history teaches us, the cultural changes live on well beyond their original purpose.
