sputnik? 
- satellite was launched before, sent this massive wave of panic 
	- because the red was ahead technologically! 
	- led to a huge amount of focus on STEM
- turns out, we actully had the satellites the whole time 
	- but eisenhower didnt want to launch them because he didnt want to deal with the fuss about how to manage airspace?






eisenhower didnt want to launch 
- didnt want to escalate?
	- was already spying, and got found out


// this entire philosiphy that

the current modern philosiphhy that science and technology should be the main focus of education was built off of a politically self-serving lie.

the current educational emphasis on sciene and technolgy, expanded in the post-sputnik era, was built on...

“Decades after Sputnik burned in the atmosphere, we’re still talking about science education as a means of security,” Miller said.


 

ce. Deeply shocked, the country responded by pouring vast sum education, science, and the space programme, which reasserted Ame leadership a decade later by putting a man on the moon. For univer science, in particular, sputnik is credited with bringing in a cornuco federal support for research, graduate study, buildings and laborato

Eventually, this largesse was choked off by the Vietnam war and the presidency.6 Sputnik was not the direct cause of this chain of events, but conventional wisdom is not entirely wrong in seeing it as the catalys hence their appropriate s

THESIS: 
The Sputnik lie, and with it massive cultural impacts, was born of a confluence of competing political interests.

- Sputnik had a massive cultural impact
	- hysteria, fear, massive focus on STEM in schools
	
- But it was a lie
	- what actually happened was...
	
- It was a lie because
	- Eisenhower's reasoning (declassified)
		- wanted covert info on Russians
		-  got caught 
		- didn't want to escalate further
	- Dems reasoning
		- wanted to make the reps look bad (had lost previous election due to being portrayed as "soft on communism" - lost China etc..
		
- conclusion?
	- But nobody questions the emphasis on STEM, even though the original premise has been falsified. Thus, history teaches us, the cultural changes live on well beyond their original purpose.

{SPUTNIK INTRO AND EXPLANATION} 
The Sputnik lie, and with it massive cultural impacts, was born of a confluence of competing political interests.

With Sputnik floating amidst the atmosphere, American society was thrown into crisis. In a period defined by national pride -- especially over technological superiority -- the Russians being first to space was catastrophic for American society: "words do not easily convey the American reaction to the Soviet satellite," writes NASA, "the only appropriate characterization that begins to capture the mood on 5 October involves the use of the word hysteria." (CITE nasa) Not only was the nation's pride damaged, but its very identity was thrown into question. Lyndon B. Johnson, the Senate Majority Leader at the time, commented that "Now, somehow, in some new way, the sky seemed almost alien. I also remember the profound shock of realizing that it might be possible for another nation to achieve technological superiority over this great country of ours." (CITE find source) Sputnik was equipped with a radio, sending out what America "believed to be impulse signals from the Soviet satellite." (CITE https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/partners/aol/special/sputnik/sput-04.html) This eerie and alien reminder of failure was not only received by The National Broadcasting Company, who "broke into their radio and television programs to enable their audiences to hear the pinging sound of the 'moon's' signal," but as the Soviets frequently mentioned, by anyone with a radio. Virtually anyone could -- and did -- hear and track what otherwise would have been an "invisible emissary." The radio transformed Sputnik into something "very real and very close," capturing and frightening "the public's imagination." (CITE https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/partners/aol/special/sputnik/main.html) Sputnik had launched, America was in crisis, and the Space Age had officially begun. The blame had to fall somewhere.


Widely accused for letting the Soviet Union overtake the U.S., the seemingly unfazed President Eisenhower became a target of national ridicule. Eisenhower was already widely viewed as a "do-nothing [...] golf and goof" of a president, and Sputnik's launch was no help to his public perception (CITE https://digitalcommons.cedarville.edu/channels/vol5/iss1/3/). However, despite the rest of the nation, Eisenhower seemed unfazed by what became known as the "Sputnik Crisis" -- "it seemed as though President Eisenhower," writes Space Age expert Martha Ackmann, "was the only American who did not initially understand the military, scientific, or cultural significance of Sputnik's chirp." (CITE https://www.bookbrowse.com/excerpts/index.cfm/book_number/1249/page_number/3/the-mercury-13). G. Mennen Williams, the governor of Michigan at the time, characterized public perception of the Eisenhower administration with a poem: 
> Oh little Sputnik, flying high
With made-in-Moscow beep,
You tell the world it's a Commie sky
and Uncle Sam's asleep.
>
You say on fairway and on rough
The Kremlin knows it all,
We hope our golfer knows enough
To get us on the ball. (CITE find) 

The Eisenhower administration, with its alarmingly unalarmed supposed "smiling incompetent" of a spearhead, was put under immense pressure. This pressure, combined with the national panic, led to lasting and extensive shifts in American society at large.


- massive focus on stem in schools
- qoutes from maclen 
- tech as the way to success

After the initial panic, Sputnik was met with an insurgence of focus on science and technology in American Society. The importance placed on science and technology today, especially in education, in large part resulted from this seemingly "dated and irrelevant"
