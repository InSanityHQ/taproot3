Forced founders (1999) (historiography book)
-   argument
	-   cause was due to economic situation in colonies and England
	-   chapter 1: viewpoints of the elite and land prospectors
		-   colonists wanted to move west, but Britain wanted to prevent them from going west and getting into a war
	-   chapter 2: two classes of British traders
		-   economic and trading clash (taxes)
		-   debtor and creditor relationships
		-   forced immigration?
		-   => wanted free market and free trade, which meant they needed independence
-   neoprogressive school
	-   because it is economically motivated
	-   each chapter focuses on a different way of how not being independent hurts them
-   discussion
-   colonial relationship: Britain uses debt and taxes to keep the population subservient

## Gordon Wood

- radicalism of the american rev

- split between noble elite and common fold
	- then the gap was bridges and reduced
- mostly through social lens
- "radical social ideas of equality"
- united through common belief 
	- best examined through the change in the lives of the common folk
- classical republican values predominated?

- historiography!
	- neowig

- social! united through values!
	- was not driven by the need for social change, but it create it?
	
- doesnt consider motivation by the powerful!

- land -> wealth
	- no class hierchy or fuedal system? so we get the american dream?

- natural meritocracy over hereditary wealth
- the goal: be disintrested in wealth! ie, have enough wealth to not have to worry.
	- right now, wealth is kinda its own pursuit, not a means to an end

## Bernard Bailyn

- ideological origins of the american revolution
- part 6!
	- colonist text were legit, used newspapers alot
	- writters!
- a lot about economics, a lot of primary sources
- influenced by british political radicals
- taxes -> british is hoplessly corrupt
- britain -> escalating conflict & enslaving america
- it was britains fault! 

- not chronoligal
	- more about ideas that guided ethos
		- also where the ideas came from and the people behind them
- corrupt british 

- we care becauseeeee
	- primary sources
	- analysis of rational colonists
	- popular opinion of british
	- reductionist! 
		- factual, not phycoanalysis? okkk
- america as noahs arc for liberty
	- pitts america vs. british

- disconent -> movement? 
	- need to create an ideology that expresses the discontent
	- articulate the nebulous grivences!
		- liberty, conspiriacy -> vehicles

- classic revisionist history?
	- uh, not in the normal sense


## linebaugh & rettiker

- multiheaded "hydra"
- similar to new left
- based on the proletariat
	- the working class, not the elite -> thus, it's new left

- main arg:
	- all about class differences
		- not just a few 'great men'
	- highlights disenfranchised
	- 3 main sections:
		- sailors, 
		- slaves,
		- mobs
- what comes around, goes around.

- too eager to view through marxist lens
	- things become overlooked
