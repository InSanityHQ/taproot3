# Celebration of Commerce!
*The Radicalism of the American Revolution*

- argues it's not about the institutions or the lite
	- instead, about the populace!
		- about "ordinary people"
- people were absorbed in the individual pursuit of money
- obsessed with commerce!

```ad-qoute
title: the motto.
On others inspriation flash, 
Give them eternal fame--
But give me cash!
```
- war of 1812 was meant to free americans of their greed.
	- revitalizing national spirit and republicanism!
	- but, ofc, it didnt work. 
	- but it did make people more ok with the state of heavy commerce
	
- jefferson came into his presidency trying to reverse the monarchizing ajendas of the federalists

- government was v minimal. ::

```ad-qoute
the delivery of the mail was the only way most citizens would know that such a government even existed.
 ```
 
- people formed a lot of societys for different agenda about social good?
- religion was a powerful uniting force
- jefferson hated the orthodoxy, and said that chrisianity was an engine for enslaving mankind
- but for common folk, religion was the way they made the world meaningful

```ad-qoute
As the Republic became democratized, it became evangelized.
 ```

- and then, morality shifted to what held those together
	- theological contract -> social contract?

- had an idea of "disciplined moral militia"

- and then it shifted to views of the revolution that united people
- when relations are defined simply by trade, then the relation becomes equal. 
	- equality through shared self-interest?
	-  doesnt matter where the dollar came from.
	
-  anyone can say "no" if they werent satisfied with the price

```ad-qoute
“The market house, like the grave, is a place of perfect equality,” -Philip Freneau
```

- equality, but not of wealth!
	- but that doesnt actully matter --  everyone *felt* more equal. 

- concept of the "self made man" was created
- bunch of stuff about gentlement, 
	- the concept was gotten rid of, 
	- and people were all reduced to the same level
