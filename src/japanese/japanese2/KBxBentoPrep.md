# bento 
## research
- japanese oldest historical record: the *Nihon Shoki*, 720 A.D.
	- mentions bento boxes as a way to have portable food, used espcially while hunting 
		- specifically hawking, meaning hunting with the aid of a trained bird
- the word itself came from a military commander, Oda Nobunaga (born 1534)
- bento becomes necessary when you can't go home / to a designated eating location for meals
	- like soldiers, when the bento was invented
- became no longer about necessity 
	- started being brought regulary to theaters
