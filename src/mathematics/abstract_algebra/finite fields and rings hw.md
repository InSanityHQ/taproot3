# Finite fields and rings

![[KBe20math530refField#Fields]]

Based on the [previous homework assignment](finite groups hw) , give some examples of **finite** fields (which are also always finite rings). Can you give examples of finite rings that are not finite fields?

Recall that the integers are our canonical example of a ring. Can you find **subrings** within the integers?
