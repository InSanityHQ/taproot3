# [[isomorphic]] groups!
[the assignment](https://nuevaschool.instructure.com/courses/4390/assignments/72472)

You had some interesting conjectures today! Notably:

1) all groups of the same size are isomorphic

2) isomorphic groups have matching sets of subgroups

Try to prove/disprove (you already noticed that proving the second would disprove the first).

If you didn't find all the subrings of Z4×Z4, do so.

Try some exercises on subgroups from 3.D-3.G in [Pinter](https://nuevaschool.instructure.com/courses/4390/files/508418?wrap=1 "Pinter Abstract Algebra-1.pdf")  [![](https://nuevaschool.instructure.com/images/svg-icons/svg_icon_download.svg) Download Pinter](https://nuevaschool.instructure.com/courses/4390/files/508418/download?download_frd=1)(there are hard copies available in the library). Don't read ahead, though.
