# [[isomorphic]] groups!
[the assignment](https://nuevaschool.instructure.com/courses/4390/assignments/72472)

You had some interesting conjectures today! Notably:

1) all [[groups]] of the same size are [[isomorphic]]
2) isomorphic groups have matching sets of [[subgroups]]
Try to prove/disprove (you already noticed that proving the second would disprove the first).
If you didn't find all the [[ring#subring|subrings]] of $\mathbb{Z_{4}} \times \mathbb{Z_{4}}$, do so.
Try some exercises on subgroups from 3.D-3.G in Pinter
