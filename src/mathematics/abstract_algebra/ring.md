Like a [[field]], but no need for multiplicative inverses.

modified from [wolfram math world](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Ring.html):

A ring in the mathematical sense is a set $S$ together with two binary operators + and * (commonly interpreted as addition and multiplication, respectively) satisfying the following conditions:

1. Additive associativity: 
	1. For all $a,b,c \in S$, $(a+b)+c=a+(b+c)$,
2. Additive commutativity:
	1. For all $a,b \in$ $S$, $a+b=b+a$,
3. Additive identity: 
	4. There exists an element $0 \in S$ such that for all $a \in S$, $0+a=a+0=a$,
5. Additive inverse: 
	1. For every $a \in S$ there exists $-a \in S$ such that $a+(-a)=(-a)+a=0$,
6. Left and right distributivity: 
	1. For all $a,b,c \in S$, $a*(b+c)=(a*b)+(a*c)$ and $(b+c)*a=(b*a)+(c*a)$,
7. Multiplicative associativity:
	1. For all $a,b,c \in$ $S$, $(a*b)*c=a*(b*c)$ (a ring satisfying this property is sometimes explicitly termed an associative ring).

## subring
Is a subset of $S$ which also satisfies the requirements for a ring
