** cauchy-schwartz
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: cauchy-schwartz
   :END:
- says that \(|E(XY)| \leq \sqrt{E(X^2)E(Y^2)}\)
  - given a case \(E(X) = E(Y) = 0\)
    - E(XY) = Cov(X,Y)
      - E(X^2) = Var(X)
      - E(Y^2) = Var(Y)
    - which means that \(|\text{Corr}(X, Y)| \leq 1\)

** jensen's inequality
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: jensens-inequality
   :END:
given a [[file:KBxRandomVariables.org][KBxRandomVariables]] \(X\),

some convex function g: \(E(g(X) \geq g(E(X))\)

#+begin_quote
  *convex* :: concave up equivalent to second derivative being â‰¥ 0
#+end_quote

if it is concave down, flip the inequality!

** markhovs inequality
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: markhovs-inequality
   :END:
- consider a setup where
  - you ask a bunch of people what their income is
    - you get an average of $100,000
      - then 2/3 group having income over $200,000 is *impossible*
        - instead, the maximum fraction of people over $200,000 is 1/2
        - or, \(P(|X| > a) < \frac{E(|X|)}{a}\)
          - a > 0

** chebyshev inequality
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: chebyshev-inequality
   :END:
\(P(|X - \mu| > a) \leq \frac{\sigma^{2}}{a^2}\) where
\(\sigma^{2} \to \text{Var(X)}\) and \(\mu \to E(X)\)
