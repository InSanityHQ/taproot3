# Day one!

colledge level probabilty and distrubtion class
based on the harvard course, which is a good resoruce!

- calculus based class ( #review)
- assuming we know
	- e shows up alot
		- the limit as n -> inf of $(1 + \frac{x}{n})^n = e^x$
		- $e^x = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{x^n}{n!} = \textrm{(the taylor series expansion)}$
		- and ofc set notation 
- if you are ok w/ coding (hell yeah) make some sims! but not today
	- for today, we are naive!
- workin w/o computer screens (nah)
- we should also have a notebook
	- we are gonna have a lot of absences (due to covid)
	- thus, organization is good!

**but wait, what is naive?**

- experiment: doing a thing, which has a random outcome
	- eg. draw 2 cards form a deck
- **the sample space**: $\Omega$. the set of all possible outcomes
	- $=\{(As, Ah), \dots \}$
- **event** is subset of the sample space
	- eg. the second card is an ace
- **the naive definition of probability** (almost never works) is P(A) = \frac{\textrm{# outcomes where a happens}}{\textrm{# outcomes}} 
	- aka, $\frac{|A|}{|\Omega|}$ where omega is the num of elements
	- idk why the first latex doesnt work


## the problem set!
