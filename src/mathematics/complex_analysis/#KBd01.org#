#+TITLE: Complex Analysis: Day 1
#+AUTHOR: Dylan Wallace

* Long prose (mainly about expectations, textbooks, learning habits, etc)
** HW and Grading

There will be HW regularly.
You should do it all, but if you're late it's not that big of an issue

* What is Complex Analysis?

Complex Analysis is the study of complex numbers, and functions between them.

Compared to Real Analysis, it can be a bit more tedious, but much more profound (t. Jana)
Real Analysis is just calculus but *uptight* (t. Jana)

* Euler's Formula

Euler's formula is

\begin{aligned}
e^{i\theta} &= \cos{(\theta)} + i\,\sin{(\theta)}
\end{aligned}

We use Calculus as well in Complex Analysis, especially the notion of a limit.
A limit formalizes the notion of "closeness."
An $\epsilon \text{-} \delta$ proof is a way to prove a limit.
A function is *continuous* if its value at a point is equal to the limit at every point.

* Exponents of (1 + i)

The function $f(n): \mathbb{R} -> \mathbb{C}, n \m$
