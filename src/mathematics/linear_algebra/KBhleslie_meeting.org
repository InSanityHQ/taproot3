Language learning happen in a lot of ways. Language Learning: context is more useful. Corpus lingustics people look into more measure.

- Reframe lexical complety to syntatic complexity
- Reframe complexity to accessibility

"Go down the rabbit hole, look at citations, etc."

Look into literacy folks, but look into corpus lingustics.

Complexity => accessability/interprebility

* Corpus Linguistics
Corpus Linguist is responsible for putting corpora together

- "What are some structures that maybe present?"
- "What are some characteristics that maybe present?"

Lexical complexity matters less than syntactic complexity.

* Evaluation Metrics
- "collocations"
- "discorse patterns"


Field is called "literacy" + "corpus linguistics"

* Target Language

** "Trans-languaging": code switching
- Strict english-only policy will be difficult
- Bilingual education programs

** Multisensory inputs
- Texts often have to be supplemented with multisensory input
- Vocabulary complexity is not the only measure of text complexity, also sentence
- Complexity => "interpretability"

* Qs
- How is WIDA levels measured

* Common Core
Common Core talks about text complexity.
