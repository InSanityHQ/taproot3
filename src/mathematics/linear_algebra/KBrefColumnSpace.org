** Because columns map to input, while rows map to output
** Linear dependence is going to have more to do with the columns
** Dot products are "linear combinations" of the columns
** It's only because we usually multiply with variables on the right. When we go backwards, then we care about the row.
* #definiton column space                                       :definition:
  The subpsace that gets hit by inputs.
* Row vs Column linear dependency
** Under what circumstances is it true that row linear independence iff column linear independence?
*** maybe in square matrices?
