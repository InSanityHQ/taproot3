#+TITLE: Dot Product Transpose Trick

The dot product is a projection of a vector onto a column space. (It's kind of like the closest vector to the out-of-range one that is in range). We can find this vector for the column space of $A$ by taking $A^Tb$. Thus, when we see this
\[\begin{aligned}
 A A^T x
\end{aligned}\]
 we are somehow 'projecting' $x$ on to $\orange A$.
