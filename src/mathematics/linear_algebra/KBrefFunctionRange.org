#+TITLE: Range of a function
* Intuition
  All of the valid outputs of the function, everything that the function can equal when fed an element of the domain.
* In the context of linear algebra (Axler 3.18)
  #+begin_quote
  For $T$ a function from $V$ to $W$, the /range/ of $T$ is the subset of $W$ consisting of those vectors that are of the form $Tv$ for some $v \in V$:
  $$\text{range }T = \{Tv : v \in V\}$$
