## Definitions

### Linear Combination
```ad-def
A *linear combination* of a list $v_1,...,v_m$ of vectors in $V$ is a vector of the form 
$$a_1 v_1 + ... + a_m v_m$$
where $a_1,...,a_m \in F$
```
The sum of a list of vectors $v_1, ... , v_m$ all multiplied by scalars $a_1, ... , a_m$
Or, adding up scalar multiples of vectors in a list


#### Properties
Can form new vectors out of old ones!

### Spans
```ad-def
The set of all linear combinations of a list of vectors $v_1, ... , v_m$ in V is called the *span* of $v_1, ... , v_m$, as denoted by span($v_1, ... , v_m$)

The span of the empty list $()$ is defined to be {0}
```

### Finite-dimensional vector space
```ad-def
A vector space is called *finite-dimensional* is some list of vectors in it spans the space
```

### Polynomial
```ad-def
$p(z) = a_0 + a_1z + a_2z^2 + ... + a_mz^m$
```

#### Properties
The span of elements A in V is the smallest subspace in V that contains all of A
This is because the span closes it under SCAMUL and addition, so it satisfies the requirements for a subspace.
