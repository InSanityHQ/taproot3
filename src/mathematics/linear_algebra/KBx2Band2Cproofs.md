# Proof... presentations?
in room, 317.

## up first, karen.
- 2B, 4
- proof by example?
	- uses the contraints given by the problem? then just, plug and chug?
		- plug in knowns for free variables and solve the next?
- actully, not a proof! doesnt ask for one.
- free variables! that's the concept here.
```ad-tip
if it's a set, use set notation! not words 
```
- #review how to take notes on proof presentations.

## Anisha
- 2B, 5
going in order?

- ooh, we solved this already?
	- our solution:
		- represent every $x^2$ as $x^2+x^3$, then whenever you need x^2, just subtract $x^3$
- seems similar up till here
- proves linear independence
	- just rearange the constants and algebra it
- proves it spans
	- just proves you can reach $x^2$ from every $x^2+x^3$
- didn't explicitly say things..
	- proved linear dependence, proved span, 
	- but didn't say that these are the things need for a basis
```ad-qoute
precise. mathematical. notation! -jana
```

## Malaika
- 2.B, 7
- on the quiz! 
- uhoh, she says it's false.
- wait a second.. we need at least 3 vectors.. 2 vecs can't possibly fit it...
- frick, messed that up.

## Sophie
- with the same problem!
	- $V=R^4$
	- v_1 through v_4 as the standard basis. or not?? 
- dammit. shoulda seen that. thought that they were elements in the vectors.
	
## Joshua
- 2.B problem 8
- direct sum means intersection is zero,
- so when u add them together, u can just show it is linearly independent

- 0 is in the set of any span of vecs.
	- there is always a linear combo to 0! you need to show it's the *only* one.

##  Davis 
- 2.C 1

- does the strat of just going back and looking for stuff work?
	- jana, says, yeah! pretty solid.
- use the appropriate results and qoute them clearly.
- how to include the actual relevant info:
	- not in parentheticals?
- how to make stuff not italic!
 ```latex
\DeclareMathOperator{\span}{span}
```

## Caroline 
- 2.C 3
- prove:
	- R^3 is a subspace of R^3!
		- reverse double containment
- planes that pass through origin in R^3 are not = R^2,
	- they are isomorphic!

```ad-def
In mathematics, an isomorphism is a structure-preserving mapping between two structures of the same type that can be reversed by an inverse mapping. Two mathematical structures are isomorphic if an isomorphism exists between them.
```

- this doesnt make them the same thing, but u can do the property mapping thing
- to take props from R^2 to R^3, we need to know more about isomorphic
- to show a subspace: 
	- additive iden
	- SCAMUL 
	- addition
	- closed
	- and, also, it needs to live in the parent space.

## Carissa 
- 2.C 4
- like karen's but with polynomials

fin. until thursday.
