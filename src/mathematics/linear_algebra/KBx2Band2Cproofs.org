- 2B, 4
- proof by example?

  - uses the contraints given by the problem? then just, plug and chug?

    - plug in knowns for free variables and solve the next?

- actully, not a proof! doesnt ask for one.
- free variables! that's the concept here.

#+begin_example
  if it's a set, use set notation! not words 
#+end_example

- #review how to take notes on proof presentations.

- 2B, 5 going in order?

- ooh, we solved this already?

  - our solution:

    - represent every \(x^2\) as \(x^2+x^3\), then whenever you need
      x^2, just subtract \(x^3\)

- seems similar up till here

- proves linear independence

  - just rearange the constants and algebra it

- proves it spans

  - just proves you can reach \(x^2\) from every \(x^2+x^3\)

- didn't explicitly say things..

  - proved linear dependence, proved span,
  - but didn't say that these are the things need for a basis

    precise. mathematical. notation! -jana

- 2.B, 7
- on the quiz!
- uhoh, she says it's false.
- wait a second.. we need at least 3 vectors.. 2 vecs can't possibly fit
  it...
- frick, messed that up.

** Sophie

   :END:

- with the same problem!

  - \(V=R^4\)
  - v_1 through v_4 as the standard basis. or not??

- dammit. shoulda seen that. thought that they were elements in the
  vectors.

- 2.B problem 8

- direct sum means intersection is zero,

- so when u add them together, u can just show it is linearly
  independent

- 0 is in the set of any span of vecs.

  - there is always a linear combo to 0! you need to show it's the
    /only/ one.

- 2.C 1

- does the strat of just going back and looking for stuff work?

  - jana, says, yeah! pretty solid.

- use the appropriate results and qoute them clearly.

- how to include the actual relevant info:

  - not in parentheticals?

- how to make stuff not italic!

- 2.C 3
- prove:

  - R^3 is a subspace of R^3!

    - reverse double containment

- planes that pass through origin in R^3 are not = R^2,

  - they are isomorphic!

#+begin_example
  In mathematics, an isomorphism is a structure-preserving mapping between two structures of the same type that can be reversed by an inverse mapping. Two mathematical structures are isomorphic if an isomorphism exists between them.
#+end_example

- this doesnt make them the same thing, but u can do the property
  mapping thing
- to take props from R^2 to R^3, we need to know more about isomorphic
- to show a subspace:

  - additive iden
  - SCAMUL
  - addition
  - closed
  - and, also, it needs to live in the parent space.

- 2.C 4
- like karen's but with polynomials

fin. until thursday.
