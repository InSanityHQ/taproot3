# Problem 21!
Suppose $V$ is finite-dimensional and $T \in L(V,W)$. Prove that $T$ is injective if and only if there exists $S \in L(W,V)$ such that $ST$ is the identity map on $V$.


3.16 injectivity is equivalent to null space equals {0}
3.15 injective: T: V -> W is injective if $Tu = Tv$ implied $u=v$
3.8 product of linear maps: 

identity map on v: Iv = v

product of linear maps:

if $T \in L(U,V)$ and $S \in L(V,W)$, then the *product* $ST \in L(U,W)$ is defined by 
$$(ST)(u)=S(Tu)$$
for all $u \in U$.
