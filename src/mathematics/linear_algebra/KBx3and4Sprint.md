# 3 and 4 sprint!

## 3.E products and quotients of vec spaces


```ad-def
title: $v+U$
addition of vec and subspace is just the subset of elements in the parent vecspace where the elements are $v+u$
```


affine subsets can be imagined as parallel, where a subset is shifted over by a vector $v$.

the quotient space is the set of all affine subsets! it's denoted as $V|U$
which is ofc also a vec space

the quotient map, the map from $V \to V|U$ is denoted as $\pi$

$\tilde{T}$ allows for dealing with one dimensionality higher. it let's you propogate the null space across higher dimensions when trying to generalize a linear map.

## duality! 
*dual space and dual map*

linear functional is a map which goes to the scalar field F. 
it's a set in $L(V, F)$

dual space, aka $V'$, is the vec space of all linear functionals!

dual basis is the dual of $v_{1}, \dots, v_{n}$ which goes to $\phi_{1}, \dots, \phi_n$ is where each $\phi_{j}$ is the linear functional which takes $v_k$ to 1 if $k=j$ and 0 else

we also get dual maps, $T'$, which is just the composition of the linear functional and the normal map

ending on, pg 104.

annihilator,  denoted as $U^0$
set of all linear functionals which take all elements to 0
ofc, the annihilator is a subspace

we can relate $T'$ and $T$ to surjective and injective
