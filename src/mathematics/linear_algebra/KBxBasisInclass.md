# Basis

```ad-def
title: lemma
something you prove with the intention to prove something else
```

easy way to check if something if linearly dependent:
if there are more vectors than dimension!

- spanning sets need to be >= len as the dimension 
	- else it wont have all the nessasarry info
	- but it needs to be the same as the dimension for it to be a **basis**
		- linearly independent and spanning
		

### One way to get anywhere = one way to get 0
true for 0, true for any other vec
- ![[KBxChapter2BReading#criterion for basis]]
- going over the proof for this.


### making something a basis
- linearly independent can be added to and turned into a basis,
- spanning set can be removed from and turned into a basis
