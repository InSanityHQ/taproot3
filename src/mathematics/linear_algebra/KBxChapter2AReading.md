# Finite-Dimensional Vector Spaces

```ad-tip
title: Review
F denotes R or C
V denotes a [[KBe20math530refVectorSpace]] over F 
```


- lin alg does not focus on arbitrary vector spaces
- it focuses on finite-dimensional vector spaces!

```ad-abstract
title: learning objectives for the chapter
- span
- linear independence 
- bases 
- dimension

```

- **notation**:
	- lists of vectors:
		- (2,1,4),(3,2,5)
			- list len 2 of vectors in R^3
		- n-tuples without surrounding parens
		
- *linear combination*
	- a linear combination of _x_ and _y_ would be any expression of the form _ax_ + _by_, where _a_ and _b_ are constants ~wiki
	- multiply each element in a list of vectors by an element in F
	- and then add them up!
	- any relation between the element scalar and what's being multiplied? can the scalars repeat?  #question
	
- *span*
	- the set of all linear combos of a list of vectors
		- denoted: span(v1,...,vm)
	- span of empty list is {0}
	- aka. linear span

```ad-tip
the span of a list of vectors in V is the smallest subspace of V containing all the vectors in the list

```ad-question
but don't you get out a single vector at the end..? because you add them? #question 
```
