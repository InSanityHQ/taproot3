# Finite-Dimensional Vector Spaces

```ad-tip
title: Review
F denotes R or C
V denotes a [[KBe20math530refVectorSpace]] over F 
```


- lin alg does not focus on arbitrary vector spaces
- it focuses on finite-dimensional vector spaces!

```ad-abstract
title: learning objectives for the chapter
- span
- linear independence 
- bases 
- dimension

```

- **notation**:
	- lists of vectors:
		- (2,1,4),(3,2,5)
			- list len 2 of vectors in R^3
		- n-tuples without surrounding parens
-
