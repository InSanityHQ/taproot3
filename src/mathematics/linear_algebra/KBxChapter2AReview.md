# Chapter 2A, In Class
you most likely want to be at [[KBxChapter2AReading]]

span of one vec, line
span of 2 vec, plane
span of 3 vec, three space
ect.

if the plane doesnt go through 0, we dont care about it! because it's a subset, not a subspace.

span: noun and a verb? no it's not... spans is the verb, right?

dimension: we don't know, what they mean! 

```ad-qoute
finite list of vectors that span the space make it easier to work with
```

P(f) are not finite!



linear indepenence: the direct sum analog for vectors
analog: the analougous thing? that's cool


every vector gives us new info
