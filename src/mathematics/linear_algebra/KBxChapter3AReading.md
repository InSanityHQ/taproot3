# Linear Maps

```ad-qoute
no one get's excited about vector spaces -axler
```

the interesting part: linear maps!

```ad-abstract
title: learning objectives
- fundementals theorem of linear maps
- matrix of linear map w.r.t. given bases
- isomorphic vec spaces
- product spaces
- quotient spaces
- duals spaces
	- vector space
	- linear map
```


# The vector space of linear maps

**key definition!**

```ad-def
title: linear map
aka *linear transformation.*

a *linear map* from $V$ to $W$ is a function $T:V \to W$ with the following properties:
**additivity**
$T(u+v) = Tu+Tv$ for all $u, v \in V$;
**homogeneity**
$T(\lambda v) = \lambda(Tv)$ for all $\lambda \in F$ and $v \in V$.
```

the functional notation T(V) is the same as the notation Tv when talking about linear maps.


```ad-def
title: notation -- $L(V,W)$
the set of all linear maps from $V$ to $W$.
```

### examples of linear maps
- 0?
	- 0 is the func that takes each ele from some vec space to the additive iden of another vec space.
		- 0v = 0
		- left: func from V to W, right: additive iden in W
		- #question what does it mean for it to be a function from V to W?
- identity, denoted $I$
	- $Iv = v$
	- maps each element to itself
linear transformation like a `.map`?
