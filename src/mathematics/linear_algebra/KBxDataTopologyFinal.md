### computing homology
â†’ [article](https://jeremykun.com/2013/04/10/computing-homology/)

- a *simplicial complex* can define a topo-space
	- essentially just think of it as glued together triangles (simplicies? are we just working in 2d?)
- something called *chains* which let us represent these simplicies in a vec space
- *boundry homomorphism* is a linmap on these chains?
- **homology groups** are defined as quotient spaces
	- $H_k(X)=\frac{\ker \partial_k}/{\text{im} \partial_{k+1}}$
