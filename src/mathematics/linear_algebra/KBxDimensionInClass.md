# Dimension

notes, inclass, on [[KBxChapter2CReading]].

### number of basis

{0} is just a point! so you have zero places to move.
thus, it has dimension 0, and its basis is len 0. 
 else, you can get **infinite number of basis in a vector space.**
 

### number of dimensions dependent on scalar field

 assume a vec space is over f!
 
vector space $C^1$ -> 2D if over R, and 1D if over C
because you need the field of scalars!


```ad-note
uncountable infinity! might check it out, later.
```

trivial extension just means doing nothing
trivial reduction just means doing nothing.

### dimension of a sum proof! oh jeez

![[KBxChapter2CReading#formula for dimension of sum of two subspaces]]
ok, reviewing it!

union of subspaces doesn't normally work well, because the result is generally not a subspace.

but it works for sets!

when two planes intersect at a line, and you sum them, then you can get anywhere in $R^3$?

don't want to overcount the intersecting line?

this still makes no sense.
