## Direct sums
Don't have the same rules when you add two together and many together!
Intersection of zero != direct sum when you are adding more than one.

$
u_1 + u_2  + ... + u_n = \{u_1+u_2  + ... + u_n \mid u_1 \in U_1 , ... ,  u_n \in U_n\}
$

If the direct sum requirements are not true, then it's just a sum.

Direct sum is all possible combos? 

When all the vectors inside the direct sum are linearly dependent, then you can't make a direct sum with them? Because really, $u_1 \in u_2$
Because the sums will not be unique. **Redundancy!**

$
U_1 = \{\begin{bmatrix} 
 1 \\
 0   
 \end{bmatrix}\}
$
$
U_2 = \{\begin{bmatrix} 
 2 \\
 0   
 \end{bmatrix}\}
$ doesn't work, cus you can just multiply all in $U_1$ by 2 to get things in $U_2$
