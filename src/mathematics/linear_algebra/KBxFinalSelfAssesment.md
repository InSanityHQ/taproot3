### Skills and Practices
**Previous -> New**

##### Explore and Organize
**Proficient -> Exemplary**
More recently for some of the harder problems, my strategy has shifted to first finding branches of concepts and results relating to the problem. For example, the most recent problem I did involved trying to navigate branching relationships between concepts -- the problem ended up being solved by representing our system of equations as an operator, thus allowing us to use the properties of an operator (surjectivity implying injectivity) to solve the problem. The process involved first trying to find branches that we could go down (generating data), navigating these branches (organizing data), and finally solving the problem with the right branch (identifying promising leads).
