# Here, we frickin, go.

### the plan
- review the rubric for all the items that I need to review
- go through the textbook abridged, with some form of interaction

- go back through the rubric and make sure I know it all.

think about: creating relation list

#### finds
- determinant
- cross product
- dot product
- add matricies
- multiply matricies
- solve system of linear equations // TODO
  
### reading?
45 pages, abridged. alright!

- addition is: C I^2 A
	- communicative 
	- identity
	- inverse
	- assosiative

- vector space is: CA AI^2 MID
	- a vector space is a set along with addition and scalar multiplication which has the following properties
