### to review
- remember
	- finite-dimensional!!
	
- find
	- Find null space  :: done!
	- find column space / basis :: done! 
	- solving systems of equations? :: skip
	- the inverse of a matrix is unique :: done!
	- complex numbers using matrices :: done!

- proves
	- Prove that any linear transformation can be represented by a matrix :: skip
	- prove that the sum of subspaces A+B is a direct sum iff A intersect B = {0} :: done
	- in a fin dim vec space, the len of any LID set is less than or equal to the len of any spanning set :: done
	- if W1 and W2 are subspaces of a vec space V such that W1 union W2 is also a subspace, then one of the spaces is contained in the other :: done
	- v1,...,vm is a list of vecs such that tv1,...,tvm is a LID in w. prove that v1,...,vm is LID. is converse true? :: done 
	- prove that a nonempty subset W of V is a subspace of V iff for each pair of vectors w1, w2 in W and each scalar c in F the vector cw1 + w2 in W. :: skip 

- review
	- linear dependence lemma :: done
	- group :: done
	- range :: done 
	- fundamental theorem :: done
	- linear maps and basis of domain :: done
		- linear maps can be uniqely defined by what they do to the basis

- questions
	- span question :: done
		- we can always remove u, and the list would be unchanged!
