[reading this article](https://medium.com/@jeremyjkun/here-s-just-a-fraction-of-what-you-can-do-with-linear-algebra-633383d4153f)


- random walk?
- linear programming! aka, linear optimization
	- simplex algo?
- error correcting (super cool)
	- hamming codes
- greedy algos and matriods
- quantum computing
- how linalg fits into deep learning
- markov chains?
- image compression
- computer vision
- nlp & word embeddings



## Ret

I would love to explore:

- Error correcting (hamming codes and such)
- NLP and Word Embeddings
- Computer vision
- Greedy algorithms and matroids
- Quantum computing
- Markov Chains

Thanks!
