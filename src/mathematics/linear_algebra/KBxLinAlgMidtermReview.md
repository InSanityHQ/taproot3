## Quiz review

- wrong list:
	- def of span (verb)
	- def of a field
	- def of a direct sum
	- sum of subspaces
	- cross product
	- connection between linear independence and systems of equations
	- geometric interpretation of dot product
	- U1 + U2 is a direct sum iff U1 intersect U2 = {0}
	- def vector space
	- elementary matrix
	- solving matrix equations
	- finding inverse
	- find the plane containing

	- prove that a set of vectors is linearly dependent if and only if you can write on of the vectors as a linear combination of the others
	- prove or give a counterexample: v1, v2, v3, v4, basis of V, and U is subspace of V.. del v3 v4 is it a basis?


- solutions
	- def of span (verb)
		- if the span of a list of vectors equals V, then the list of vecs spans V
			- ie. if it contains all the nessasarry info, then it spans.
	- def of a field
		- a set containing at least two distinct elements 0 and 1, along with the operations + and * as defined on the reals/complexs.
			- commutativity
			- associativity
			- additive identity
			- multiplicative identity
			- additive inverse 
			- multiplicative inverse
			- distributive property
	- def direct sum
		- sum of subspaces where each element in the resultant subspace can be written uniquely as a sum of the elements in the original subspaces
	- sum of subspaces
		- subspaces containing the set of all possible linear combinations from the union of the original subspaces
	- cross product #TODO!
		- the determinant thingy, or
		- $|A||B| \sin \theta n$
			- n is the unit vector orthogonal to vectors A and B
			
	- connect between linear independence and systems of equations
		-"if we take the coefficients of a system of equations as vectors, then the vectors are linearly independent if the system has one solution, and linearly dependent if the system has either zero or infinite solutions" 

	- geometric interpretation of dot product
		- %%projection of one vector onto the other times the magnitude of the vector %%
		- magnitude of projection of a vector onto another vector times the magnitude of the other vector
			- $|A||B| \cos \theta$
	- def vector space
		- set V with addition and scalar multiplication such that there is
			- additive identity 
			- additive inverse (no multiplicative inverse!)
			- commutativity
			- assosiativty 
			- distibutive property
	- elementary matrix
		- identity matrix with one row operation applied
