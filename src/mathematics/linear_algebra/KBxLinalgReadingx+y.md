# x + y, Eugenia Cheng

- def of "woman" is constructed, arbitrary
	- and they hurt! but mathematical thinking can help
- mathematics is not just about numbers and equations, even tho it starts with them
	- at the heart of mathematics is the **framework for making arguments**
		- which had abstraction and logic
- def abstraction: seeing past surface details in a situation to find it's core
	- hmm... i don;t agree with this. it's less about seeing "past" to find a core than it is about zooming out until the details are irrelevant, and seeing the patterns
	- does abstraction get to the core? ig it does in the sense that it distils..
	
- **two cultures of mathematics**
	- problem solving
	- theory building
		- but what does this mean?
## theories
- descriptive, not prescriptive
	- hmm... what about axioms? 
- works at higher levels of abstraction
- the right abstraction hold great power in explanability
- she is proposing one such abstraction / reframing, but for gender!

## the problem
*what is it?*
divisivness of arguments around gender equality.

- society get's distracted by the argument of how men and women are different
	- this is a detraction! not the right argument
	- because it draws us into a meta-argument
		- this argument about what we should be arguing about only maintains the status quo
		- but, mathematics is v good at sorting this stuff out!
		
## math time
- mathematical deduction is not about averages on a large sample set
	- instead, they use logic, not evidence
		- reductionist? assumes our logic is good enough
- individual experiences do not generalize to large groups
	- **the reverse is also true**
- we can get around this with a case study, and then trying to generalize 
- yooo she does [[KBxSystemsofSystemsinNatureandDeepLearning#category theory]]
	- says that a similar type of seemingly small abstraction is possibly what she has now
- not mathematics of gender, but a mathematical approach to gender
	- ie. a redefining
	
- continual abstractions is the process of math

- statisical link is not enough! math looks for causality
- set theory asserts that math is fundementally about membership, whereas category theory asserts that it is fundementally about relasionships

- she hopes to focus on relationships instead of intrinsic characteristics
- abstractions can be temporary! you can details back in later

### dimensions

- because dimensions are by definiton indipendent, it's hard to define new ones
	- as you can't describe them w/ the existing dims
- looking at too low of a dimensions messes things up
	- eg. a shadow instead of an object
	
lmao aight

## inclass
abstractions can be applied cyclicy (ie. vec to matrix to tensor)
