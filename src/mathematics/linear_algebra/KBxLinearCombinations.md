# Linear Combinations


Given a set of vectors, $v_1, v_2, ... v_m$, a linear combination of such vectors would be the sum of each vector multiplied by some scalar: $y = c_1 v_1 + c_2 v_2 + ... + c_m v_m$
in this case, y is a linear combination of the list of vectors $v_1, v_2, ... v_m$

essentially, construct a new vector out of old ones multiplied by scalars.
