# title!

```ad-def
**WLOG:** 
w/o loss of generallity.

*The term is used to indicate the assumption that follows is chosen arbitrarily, narrowing the premise to a particular case, but does not affect the validity of the proof in general.*

```

ie, with two options, u2 in u1 or u1 in u2, dont have to do it twice can just write wlog

opposite of specificaty

proof by contrapositive: really a proof by contradiction
contradiction is a superset


contradiction symbol: # rotated 45 

### coco's proof!
13.

really pretty notes.. ask about software #review

u1 and u2 are contained in u3.. so u1 union u3 is just u3


backwards E: theres exists

upside down A: for all

uhm- 

### i need glasses


double containment proof
