# ACT (applied category theory) <> linguistics? 
*sounds epic.* 

talk with [Tai-Danae Bradley](https://www.math3ma.com/about)
- she took, so can ask about: group theory and measure theory

- wrote the articles as a study tool, thought that the mathematical language was "a little terse"
- she chatted with 3b1b? also runs [pbs infinite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIwnCoqx91Q) (that's her)
- wait... she works at googlex?? "the moonshot factory"  sick. [[KBxSort#moonshot]]
	- or, worked? past tense? 
	- recently spun out of alphabet and now works at https://www.sandboxaq.com (broke ssl?) #revisit check out later when not on nueva wifi


## linguistics and category theory

idea of algebraic: orange + fruit → orange fruit
also an idea of statistical: orange + idea → orange idea? doesn't make sense. this is represented with frequency

is some type of mathematical structure
→ uses [[KBxSystemsofSystemsinNatureandDeepLearning#category theory]] and [[mathematics/quantum/index]]

### machine systems of language understanding
now we are talking about GPT3 and such
[corsaurus](https://corsaur.us) and [pomes](https://poems.jklsnt.com/inputPage) might be useful here
asked for gpt to compare dolphins and some random singer, and it worked great! 

so she asks, essentially, wtf? what is the math here, and how does it do it?
answer: category theory, apparently. 

> CT is the network of relationships between mathematical objects

**CT is the bridge.**

objects and morphisms 

#### The Yoneda Lemma
"an objet is completely determined by its relationships to other objects"
this is, up to isomorphism [[KBx3DInclass#isomorphism]] [[KBx3DInclass#isomorphism relations]]

two sets have the same cardinality iff they have the same num of elements
set's Z and X, $X^{Z}$ is the set of all functions from Z → X 

- the actual definition
given sets X and Y, then X is isomorphic to Y iff $X^{Z} \cong Y^Z$ for all sets Z.
