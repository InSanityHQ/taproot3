starting, halfway through!

- days of autonomy:
	- the amount of time u operate on soley battery power 
		- ie. all C and no G
	- #question why is this a concept measured in days? is it for breakdowns?
		- oh, for stuff like bad weather
			- what if it's cloudy for a few days?
	
- DoD: Depth of Discharge
	- less you drain, longer the battery will live! 	
		- ooh.. this is something we are gonna have to optimize for.
	- eg. drain only 20% will make the bat last twice as long as when draining 50%?
	- SoC: state of charge. inverse of DoD
	
- tempature matters! alot!
	- changes capacity and lifespan
	- colder it is, the larger it needs to be to store power

- deep charge vs car bat
	- car: high current discharge and fast recharge
	- deep charge: gradual discharge, slow recharge, daily cycle
	- car bats will die quick when used for bat banks!
- DoD chart

	- for lead acid! very diff w/ lithim ion
	
- **charging states**
