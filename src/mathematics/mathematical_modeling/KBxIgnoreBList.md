# This looks like a job for me, 
so everybody, just follow me!!

## Attributes
quantitative
1. Voltage (V)
2. Capacity (Ah or Wh)
4. Type of current (DC or AC)
5. Charge/discharge rate (A or W)
6. Depth of discharge (%) 
3. Type of battery (Li-ion, lead-acid, etc)

 qualitative
1. Cycle count (lifetime)
2. Environmental score
3. Cost
