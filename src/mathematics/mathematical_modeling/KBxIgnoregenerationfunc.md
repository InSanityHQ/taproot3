- we need to figure out:
	- what is the curve of generation over a day
	- how does this curve shift over the seasons?



- our inputs
	- location
	- time of year (season)

- output
	- generation curve over a day



look into: Global Tilted Irradience.

**all we care about is the relative shape and how the relative shape changes!**
this is because the other stuff will be consistent, and we aren't recommending a solar system

### terms:

solar irradiance: power per unit area (W/m^2)
integrated over time gives us: insolation (j/m^2)
solar irradiance aka solar flux: power per unit area!

TSI: total solar irradiance. when the sun is perpendicular! over a sqaure meter. this is just a constant


zenith angle: angle between suns rays and vertical direction (of earth).
"local normal to earths surface" and sun rays (line between point on earth surface and sun)

declination angle: lattitude of point directly under the sun at **noon**
complement of solar zenith angle

subsolar point: point that is closest to the sun on a planet

hour angle _h_: defined as the longitude of the subsolar point relative to its position at noon. AKA how far it moves in an hour! 

A cos zenith angle is the area of sunlight recieved per area on earth AKA how much sunlight area ur actully getting for an area on earth.


### helpful relations

spherical law of cosines!




Q¯day=S0πd¯d2[h0 sinϕ sin δ+cosϕ cos δ sin h0]
