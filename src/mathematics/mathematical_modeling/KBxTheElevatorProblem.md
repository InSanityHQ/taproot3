# Elevator?

need a sorta formal writeup

15+10+10*n where n is the number of floors



```ad-abstract
Create a single sentence that calculates the time required for 10 people to go to floor n. 
Your sentence should:
-   be mathematically correct.
-   make your English teacher proud.
-   include units.
Optionally, create a second sentence that uses variables for loading time, unloading time, and travel time between consecutive floors.
```


To calculate the number of seconds required to reach floor $n$, one must combine the ground loading time, the unloading time, and the travel time to create the formula: $(15+10+10n)s = (25+10n)s$ respectively.

Using variable times $g$, $u$, and $r$ for ground loading, unloading, and travel time, the formula becomes: $g+u+rn$
