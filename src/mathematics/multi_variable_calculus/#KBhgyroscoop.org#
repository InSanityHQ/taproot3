* Precessional Velocity
Taking the setup, we can figure the sum of the angular momentums and leverage it to figure the spin angular momentum.

Let's first define a system: $\hat{i}$ is "right" on the figure, $\hat{j}$ "in" the page, $\hat{k}$ "up" the figure.

We note that the normal spin of the flywheel gives us:

\begin{equation}
   \vec{L}_s = I\vec{\omega}_s \hat{i}
\end{equation}

As the flywheel is rotating at a constant speed, we have actually no torque that this contributes --- that is $\frac{d\vec{L}_s}{dt 

Furthermore, we can figure torque---and subsequent angular momentum contribution---of gravity as follows:

\begin{equation}
    \vec{\tau}_g = lmg \hat{j}
\end{equation}
