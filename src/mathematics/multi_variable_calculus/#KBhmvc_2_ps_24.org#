Here are four easy integrals.

* Single Value Function
#+begin_quote
\begin{align}
   &f_1: \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^1 \\ 
&f_1(x,y) = 0
\end{align}

What's the area of this function?
#+end_quote

We can take the area of the shape, essentially by taking the volume by height $1$: that is, for a rectangle of $l,w,h$, its top-area is simply $l\cdot w$, also known as $lw\cdot 1$. Therefore:

\begin{equation}
   \int_0^7 \int_0^5 1 dx\ dy = 35
\end{equation}

The area of the shape is therefore $35$.

* Area of the Plane
We want to first figure the correction per every given slice $dA=n\ dV$ to setup a surface integral. By pythagoras (i.e. projecting the changes to the parallelity of the surface), we have that:

\begin{equation}
   dA = \sqrt{1+\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\right)^2+\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\right)^2}\ dV
\end{equation}

#+begin_quote
What's the area of the following function by $(5,7)$?

\begin{align}
   &f_2: \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^1 \\ 
&f_2(x,y) = 2x+3y+10
\end{align}
#+end_quote

\begin{equation}
   dA = \sqrt{1+4+9} dV = \sqrt{14}\ dV
\end{equation}

Therefore, taking the integral:

\begin{align}
   &\int_0^5 \int_0^7 \sqrt{14}(2x+3y+10)\ dy\ dx \\
\Rightarrow & \sqrt{14}\int_0^5 \int_0^7 (2x+3y+10)\ dy\ dx 
\end{align}

At this point, we absolve the need to leverage a tonne of fractions by taking the inner integral digitally.

#+begin_src sage
f(x,y) = 2*x+3*y+10
f.integrate(y, 0, 7).integrate(x, 0,5)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 1785/2

\begin{align}
    &\sqrt{14}\int_0^5 \int_0^7 (2x+3y+10)\ dy\ dx \\
\Rightarrow &\sqrt{14}\frac{1785}{2}\\
\Rightarrow &3339.43
\end{align}

It appears that the surface area is about $3339.43$ units.

* Area of a Parabola 
#+begin_quote
What's the area of the following function by $(5,7)$?

\begin{align}
   &f_3: \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^1 \\ 
&f_3(x,y) = x^2
\end{align}
#+end_quote

We will again find the area correction factor:

\begin{equation}
   dA = \sqrt{1+4x^2}\ dV
\end{equation}

And therefore, taking the integral:

\begin{equation}
  \int_0^5 \int_0^7 \sqrt{1+4x^2}\ d
\end{equation}
