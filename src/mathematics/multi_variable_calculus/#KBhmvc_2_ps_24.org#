Here are four easy integrals.

* Single Value Function
#+begin_quote
\begin{align}
   &f_1: \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^1 \\ 
&f_1(x,y) = 0
\end{align}

What's the area of this function?
#+end_quote

We can take the area of the shape, essentially by taking the volume by height $1$: that is, for a rectangle of $l,w,h$, its top-area is simply $l\cdot w$, also known as $lw\cdot 1$. Therefore:

\begin{equation}
   \int_0^7 \int_0^5 1 dx\ dy = 35
\end{equation}

The area of the shape is therefore $35$.

* Area of the Plane
We want to first figure the correction per every given slice $dA=n\ dV$ to setup a surface integral. By pythagoras, we have that:

\begin{equation}
   dA = \sqrt{1+\left(\} 
\end{equation}
