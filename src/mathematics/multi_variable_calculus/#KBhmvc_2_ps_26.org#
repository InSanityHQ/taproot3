* Tiling the Pringlehouse
As a review, our pringles shaped house has the following parametres:

\begin{equation}
   \begin{cases}
   x(t) = 30cos(t)\\ 
   y(t) = 20sin(t)\\ 
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

and the roof is defined by:

\begin{equation}
r(x,y) = \frac{1}{400}\left(\sqrt{3}x-y\right)^2 - \frac{1}{400}\left(\sqrt{3}y-x\right)^2 + 10
\end{equation}

We will first convert the above function into rectangular bounds to take the area of.

\begin{align}
   &x = 30cos(t) \\
\Rightarrow &\frac{x}{30} = cos(t) \\ 
\Rightarrow &t = arccos\left(\frac{x}{30}\right) 
\end{align}

Supplying this back to the original expression for y: 

\begin{align}
   y &= 20sin\left(arccos\left(\frac{x}{30}\right)\right) \\
&=20\sqrt{1-\left(\frac{x}{30}\right)^2}
\end{align}

Therefore, the actual integral:

\begin{equation}
   \int_{-30}^{30} \int_{-20\sqrt{1-\left(\frac{x}{30}\right)^2}}^{20\sqrt{1-\left(\frac{x}{30}\right)^2}}\ 1 dy\ dx
\end{equation}

We will endeavor now to use technology.

#+begin_src sage
var("x y")
f(x,y) = 1
f.integrate(y, -20*sqrt(1-(x/30)^2), 20*sqrt(1-(x/30)^2)).integrate(x, -30,30)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: (x, y)
: 600*pi

It appears that the area of the floor is $600\pi$.

We can do this something for the function of the roof. We will first figure correction factor $dA$, then take the integral as prescribed.

\begin{align}
   dA &= \sqrt{1+\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\right)^2+\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\right)^2} 
\end{align}

At this point, we realize that the actual function will turn to be much too complicated to integrate by hand at this moment; therefore, we will create the expression digitally.

#+begin_src sage
r(x,y) = (1/400)*(sqrt(3)*x-y)^2 - (1/400)*(sqrt(3)*y+x)^2 + 10
da = sqrt(1+r.diff(x)^2+r.diff(y)^2)
monte_carlo_integral(da.integrate(y, -20*sqrt(1-(x/30)^2), 20*sqrt(1-(x/30)^2)), [-30], [30], 10000000)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: (2002.2850495295995, 0.16423722045912287)

Looks like the result is converting to about $2002.2$ for this shape.

* Three Dimensional Region!
Slowly adding up the arguments to this figure reveals its general shape:

#+begin_src sage
f(x) = 1-x^2
plot(f, -2, 2)
#+end_src

And, adding up the $y$ component:

#+begin_src sage
f(x,y) = 1-x^2-y^2
plot3d(f, (x,-2,2), (y,-2,2)) + plot3d(0, (x,-2,2), (y,-2,2))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

We can see that the positive component exists at $x=[-1,1]$, $y=[-1,1]$. If the same pattern holds, then, the maximum volume would be over areas:

\begin{equation}
    x=[-1,1], y=[-1,1], z=[-1,1]
\end{equation}

Taking the actual integral:

#+begin_src sage
a(x,y,z) = 1-x^2-y^2-z^2
a.integrate(x,-1,1).integrate(y,-1,1).integrate(z,-1,1)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 0

Shockingly, the resulting integral is $0$. However, we can actually move the bounds to see that all other manifestations about this point would actually result in even more negative values.

#+begin_src sage
a(x,y,z) = 1-x^2-y^2-z^2
a.integrate(x,-1,1).integrate(y,-1,1).integrate(z,-1,1)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 0

Taking the Jacobian matrix of this expression would reveal that:

\begin{equation}
   \nabla a = \begin{bmatrix} 
-2x \\
-2y \\
-2z
\end{bmatrix} 
\end{equation}

We see that there is no other point but $(0,0,0)$ is the maxima, and---by the pattern of the function---holding any two variables constant and squaring the remaining one will approach $0$ (the smallest non-negative value) at bounds $[-1,1]$. Therefore, it makes sense that the bounds prescribed would be the actual bounds desired.

* Spinning around the origin
I suppose intuitively the function needs to be axially symmetric to actually perform this trick. This means that, for exponential functions, it has to have a square (or a square of a square, etc.) term on the $x$ term to manifest a symmetry about $y$ axes by the negative and positive values of $x$ being squared 

Otherwise, the "spun" result would have uneven edges that the "squishing"/dimentionality reduction of the square root will render inoperable.
