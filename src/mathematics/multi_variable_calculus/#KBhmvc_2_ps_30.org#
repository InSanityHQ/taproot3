* Jacobian Determinant for Polar
We are to determine (pun not intended) the polar correction factor for a double integral, $dA= r\ dr\ d\theta$.

To do this, we will have to first figure the change of bases expressions such that we can take:

\begin{equation}
   f(x,y) = g(r, \theta) 
\end{equation}

Fortunately, this is already derived to use from before.

\begin{equation}
   \begin{cases}
   x = r\cos\theta \\
   y = r\cos\theta \\
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
