* Taylor Series in $e^x$
#+begin_quote
Calculate, from the big scary formula, the Taylor series for $e^x$, centered around $x=2$. 
#+end_quote

\begin{equation}
   f(x) = e^x = e^2 + e^2(x-2) + \frac{e^2(x-2)^2}{2} + \frac{e^2(x-2)^3}{3} \cdots + \frac{e^2(x-2)^n}{n}

** Derivative Matrix 14
#+begin_quote
Find the derivative matrix of 

\begin{equation}
f:\mathbb{R}^4 \to \mathbb{R}^5; f(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4) = \begin{bmatrix}
x_1 x_3 \\
\tan(x_4) \\
-\ln(x_2) \\
(3x_1-2)^4 \\
1729
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\begin{bmatrix}
x_3 & 0 & x_1 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 0 & \sec^2(x_4)\\
0 & \frac{-1}{x_2} & 0 & 0\\
12(3x_1-2)^3 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0
\end{bmatrix}

** Facing an Arbitrary Direction
#+begin_quote
Suppose you have a function $f(x,y); f:\mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^1$. Imagine you are standing at this function, at the point $(x,y)$, facing $\theta$. What is the slope? For what value is the slope greatest? Upwards? Downwards? Flat?
#+end_quote

*** Slope at point $\theta$
The slope at point $\theta$ is as follows:

\begin{equation}
f_x (x,y) \cos(\theta) + f_y (x,y) \sin(\theta)
\end{equation}

*** Greatest slope Upwards

\begin{equation}
max.\ \frac{d}{d\theta}( f_x (x,y) \cos(\theta) + f_y (x,y) \sin(\theta))
\end{equation}

*** Greatest slope Downwards

Given the max $\theta$ as derived above:

\begin{equation}
\pi  - \theta
\end{equation}

*** Angle of Flat Slope

\begin{equation}
\theta = \arctan(\frac{-f_x (x,y)}{f_y (x,y)})
\end{equation}

* Sand Dunes

#+begin_quote
You are trudging across a field of sand dunes, which the prevailing winds have blown into perfect, parallel, straight lines (or straight ridges, rather). You know that if you walk directly north-northeast, you'll make it to the oasis city of Iskendrebad. The landscape follows the function $f(x,y) = \sin(x)$; you're at the point with $x$ coordinate $23\pi/3$ and $y$ coordinate $37$.

** What is your elevation
At that point, you are at an elevation of $\sin(\frac{23 \pi}{3}) = \frac{-\sqrt{3}}{2}$

** What does your hike look like?
"North-northeast" could translate an angle of roughly $68^{\circ} \approx 0.0174533\ rad$. Slicing though the manifold with a line $y=2.475x$, which represents the same angle...

We first parameterize the slice equation as follows:

\begin{align*}
y = 2.475t \\
x = t
\end{align*}

The function at $f(t,2.475t)$, therefore, is:

\begin{equation}
   f(t,t) = \sin(t) 
\end{equation}

Hence, the hike will also behave as $f(t) = \sin(t)$.

** What's the function for the slope along your hike?

\begin{equation}
    f(t) = \cos(t)
\end{equation}

** How steep is the sand dune at the point you're standing (in the direction you're hiking)?
As per above, the direction in which we are standing is at $68^{\circ}$. This would represent a direction vector of:

\begin{equation}
   \begin{bmatrix}
0.374606 \\ 
0.927183 
   \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

The gradient of the function at point at $(\frac{23\pi}{3}, 37)$:

\begin{equation}
\begin{bmatrix}
-\frac{1}{2} \\
0
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

Therefore, the slope at that point is:

\begin{equation}
   \begin{bmatrix}
0.374606 \\ 
0.927183 
   \end{bmatrix} \cdot \begin{bmatrix}
-\frac{1}{2} \\
0
\end{bmatrix} = -0.1873032967
\end{equation}

This would amount to a slope of $\arctan(-0.1873032967) \approx -10.609^{\circ}$
