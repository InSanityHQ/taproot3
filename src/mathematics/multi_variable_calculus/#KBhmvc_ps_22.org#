* Roofs Number 3
One possible design for one side of the roof would be a simple cubic function; that:

\begin{equation}
    f(x,y) = \frac{1}{8} x^3 \{0 \leq x \leq 4, -5 \leq y \leq 5\}
\end{equation}

** Slope in Middle
The "middle" of the roof, therefore, is the location $(2,0)$, as indicated by the blue dot above.

Standing in the middle, and facing the "ridge" ($+x$) direction, we could calculate the slope of the roof.

The vector facing the ridge of the roof, to the positive $x$ direction, is represented by

\begin{equation} \begin{bmatrix}
1 \\
0
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

the gradient of this function is represented by:

\begin{equation} \begin{bmatrix}
\frac{3}{8}x^2 \\
0
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

Therefore, at the center point as indicated, the gradient is:

\begin{equation} \begin{bmatrix}
6 \\
0
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}


Computing the dot product of the direction and the gradient as found, we arrive that --- at the center --- the slope is:

\begin{equation} \begin{bmatrix}
1 \\
0
\end{bmatrix} \cdot \begin{bmatrix}
6 \\
0
\end{bmatrix} = 6
\end{equation}

Therefore, the slope as indicated is $6 \approx 80.5^{\circ}$.

** Facing the Peak 
We first determine a vector that originates from the center of the roof, and facing towards one of the ridges; that:

\begin{equation}
   \begin{bmatrix} 
4 \\
5
   \end{bmatrix} - \begin{bmatrix}
2 \\
0
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
2 \\
5
\end{bmatrix} 
\end{equation}

Normalizing this vector, we arrive at:

\begin{equation}
   \begin{bmatrix} 
\frac{2}{\sqrt{29}} \\
\frac{5}{\sqrt{29}} \\
   \end{bmatrix} 
\end{equation}

We will then project the gradient at the center point atop this vector:

\begin{equation}
    \begin{bmatrix} 
\frac{2}{\sqrt{29}} \\
\frac{5}{\sqrt{29}} \\
   \end{bmatrix} \cdot \begin{bmatrix}
6 \\
0
\end{bmatrix} = \frac{12}{\sqrt{29}}
\end{equation}

Therefore, the slope as indicated is $\frac{12}{\sqrt{29}} \approx 65.83^{\circ}$.

** Maximizing the Angle
To face in the steepest direction, we will need to face the direction of the gradient. As the gradient is

\begin{equation}
   \begin{bmatrix} 
6 \\0
   \end{bmatrix} 
\end{equation}

as derived above, the direction of the gradient is therefore: 

\begin{equation}
   \begin{bmatrix} 
\frac{6}{6} \\0
   \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 
1 \\0
   \end{bmatrix} 
\end{equation}

** Deriving Velocity
The process of acceleration is modeled by the following expression:

\begin{equation}
    a(t) = -3 cos(t)\hat{i} - 2 sin(t) \hat{j} + 0 \hat{k}
\end{equation}

We begin by taking an indefinite integral in each component to result in the expression for velocity.

\begin{align}
    \int a(t) dt &= \int -3 cos(t)\hat{i} - 2 sin(t) \hat{j} + 0 \hat{k}\ dt \\
    &= (-3 sin(t) + C_1) \hat{i} + (2 cos(t) + C_2) \hat{j} + C_3 \hat{k}\ dt 
\end{align}

Though this expression, we supply the base state $(0,2.1,1)$ at $t=0$ to solve for the constants. 

\begin{equation}
    (0, 2.1, 1) &= C_1 \hat{i} + (2+C_2) \hat{j} + C_3 \hat{k}\ 
\end{equation}

Therefore, we could deduct that $C_1 = 0$, $C_2 = 2.1$, $C_3 = 1$. Hence:

\begin{equation}
    v(t) &= (-3 sin(t)) \hat{i} + (2 cos(t) + 0.1) \hat{j} + 1 \hat{k}
\end{equation}

We could proceed to graph this expression:

#+begin_src sage
f(t) = (-3*sin(t), 2*cos(t)+0.1, 1)
parametric_plot(f, (t, -5, 5), thickness=5)
#+end_src

** Deriving Position
The process of position is the indefinite integral of the velocity expression:

\begin{align}
    \int v(t) dt &= -3 sin(t) \hat{i} + (2 cos(t) + 0.1) \hat{j} + \hat{k}\ dt\\
&= (3cos(t)+C_1) \hat{i} + (2 sin(t) + 0.1t + C_2) \hat{j} + (t + C_3) \hat{k}
\end{align}

Again, we supply the base state $(3,0,12)$ at $t=0$ to solve for the constants.

\begin{equation}
    (3,0,12) = (3+C_1) \hat{i} + C_2 \hat{j} + C_3 \hat{k}
\end{equation}

Therefore, we deduct that $C_1=0$, $C_2 = 0$, $C_3 = 12$. Hence:

\begin{equation}
x(t) = 3cos(t) \hat{i} + (2 sin(t) + 0.1t ) \hat{j} + (t + 12) \hat{k}   
\end{equation}

We could proceed to graph this expression:

#+begin_src sage
f(t) = (3*cos(t), (2*sin(t)+0.1*t), t+12)
parametric_plot(f, (t, -5, 5), thickness=5)
#+end_src

* Optimizing a Function

\begin{equation}
    h(x,y) = (x^2-2y+7) \hat{i} + (x^2 + y^2) \hat{j}
\end{equation}

Optimizing a function $h: \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^2$ requires maximizing-minimizing various dimensions of output. It is possible to optimize along a direction --- thereby turning the problem onto one which involves the optimization of two functions $\mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^1$. Or, it is possible to optimize the magnitude.

** Optimizing Along a Dimention
For optimizing the output along $\hat{i}$, we create an expression $g:\mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^1$ such that:

\begin{equation}
g(x,y) = (x^2-2y+7)
\end{equation}

Taking all the first and second derivatives of this expression, therefore, would be:

\begin{align}
    g_x = 2x \\
    g_y = -2 \\
    g_xx = 2 \\
    g_yy = 0 \\
    g_xy = 0 
\end{align}

Evidently, there is no zeros in $(g_x, g_y)$, meaning there are no minima or maxima in this dimension. Optimizing in the other dimention would follow the same procedure. 
 
For optimizing along $\hat{j}$, we repeat the same procedure. We create an $f: \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^1$ such that:

\begin{equation}
   f(x,y) = x^2 + y^2
\end{equation}

Taking, again, all derivatives of this expression:

\begin{align}
    f_x = 2x \\
    f_y = 2x \\
    f_{xx} = 2 \\
    f_{yy} = 2 \\
    f_{xy} = 0 
\end{align}

We could see that, at $(0,0)$, $\nabla g = 0$. Applying the second partial derivative test at this point, we deduct that:

\begin{equation}
    h = 4 - 0 = 4
\end{equation}

As $h$ is positive, and both $f_{xx}$ and $f_{yy}$ is positive, we deduct that the point $(0,0)$ is a local minimum in the $\hat{j}$ dimension.

** Optimizing for Magnitude
The magnitude of the output space of this function, therefore, is:

\begin{equation}
|h(x,y)| = \sqrt{(x^2-2y+7)^2 + (x^2 + y^2)^2}
\end{equation}

Of course, we could see that, as the output of the square root function is always positive, optimizing this function would be functionally the same as optimizing for $(x^2-2y+7)^2 + (x^2 + y^2)^2$. 

We first expand this expression by expanding all squares of expressions:

\begin{equation}
2x^4 + 2x^2y^2 + y^4 - 4x^2y + 14x^2 + 4y^2 - 28y + 49
\end{equation}

We then proceed to optimize a function $g: \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^1$ defined by this expression using the traditional second partial derivative test:

\begin{equation}
   g(x,y) =  2x^4 + 2x^2y^2 + y^4 - 4x^2y + 14x^2 + 4y^2 - 28y + 49
\end{equation}

To begin with this task, we first take the first and second partial derivatives of this expression:

\begin{align}
   g_x &= 8x^3 + 4xy^2 - 8xy + 28x \\
   g_y &= 4x^2y + 4y^3 -4x^2 + 8y - 28 \\
   g_{xx} &= 24x^2 + 4y^2 -8y +28\\
   g_{yy} &= 4x^2 + 12y^2 + 8 \\
   g_{xy} &= 8xy - 8x
\end{align}

To figure the critical points of this expression, we must solve for all values such that:

\begin{align}
8x^3 + 4xy^2 - 8xy + 28x &= 0 \\
4x^2y + 4y^3 -4x^2 + 8y - 28 &= 0 
\end{align}

Leveraging the first expression, we hold $x$ constant and solve a quadratic expression in $y$:

\begin{equation}
    y = \pm \sqrt{ -2x^2 - 6 } +1
\end{equation}

Substituting this expression for $y$ onto that below for $x$, we derive an expression in $x$ for the zero.

\begin{equation}
    
\pm 4x^2(\sqrt{ -2x^2 - 6 } + 1) \pm 4(\sqrt{ -2x^2 - 6 } +1)^3 -4x^2 \pm 8 (\sqrt{ -2x^2 - 6 } +1) - 28 &= 0 
\end{equation}

At this point, we could solve for expressions for $x$ for each combinations of $\pm$ to figure critical points, then apply the second derivative test to figure the optimized points of magnitude. However, this expression, per discussion, is computationally much complex to optimize.
