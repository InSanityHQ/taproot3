* 1.
** a)
No function possible. It's a function of $t$ but not one of $x$.
** b)
Done on Geogebra
** c)
I'm too lazy to come up with an actual solution, but the steps is as follows:
For the start and end point, we just plug in values for t. We get $(25, 125-5c)$ for the starting point, and $(49, 343-7c)$
As for the length, we use a modified arc length formula. We take the integral of $\sqrt{\left(\left(\frac{d}{dt}[x(t)]\right)^2 + \left(\frac{d}{dt}[y(t)]\right)^2\right)}$ from $t=5$ to $t=7$.
