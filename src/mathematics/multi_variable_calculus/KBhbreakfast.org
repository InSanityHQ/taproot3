Hi Andrew,
I am not sure if I can bring you breakfast, but here's a small (though actually kind of hard) puzzle.

The following array encodes a string by ASCII codes:

#+begin_src clojure
'(33 126 115 97 102
  107 107 101 114 98
  32 111 109 111 115
  32 125 39 101 114
  101 82)
#+end_src

Although... I made some alterations to it such that it will be a little harder than usual to decipher.

-----

Here's the solution:

#+begin_src clojure
(let [breakfast '(33 126 115 97 102
                     107 107 101 114 98
                     32 111 109 111 115
                     32 125 39 101 114
                     101 82)]
  (apply str (map-indexed
              #(char (if (= (mod %1 5) 0)
                       (- %2 10) %2)) (reverse breakfast))))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Here's some breakfast!

Anyways. Thank you very much for all that you have done for me this semester!
