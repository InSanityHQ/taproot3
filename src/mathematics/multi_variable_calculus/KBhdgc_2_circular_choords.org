There is brief discussion in the DGC book with respect to cylindrical coordinates; let's define a system oriented along the following figure given by the book:

* Cylindrical coordinates

let's return to our originally expression for a surface integral with respect to some surface with normal $\hat{n}$.

\begin{equation}
   \iint_S \vec{F} \cdot \hat{n}\ dS 
\end{equation}

Let's figure out the surface integral of a "cylindrical cuboid" (spinning a cube around $z$) on this plane!

We will define the center of the cube to be at $(r, \theta, z)$, and its "width" to be at some infinitesimal $\Delta r$. Therefore, the "front" (curved) face is located at, sweeping across $\theta$ and $z$:

\begin{equation}
   \left(r + \frac{\Delta r}{2}, \theta, z\right)
\end{equation}


We will be calculating flux that travels across this surface. The "material" that we need to push through would be:

\begin{equation}
   \left(r+ \frac{\Delta r}{2}\right) 
\end{equation}

Additionally, the cross-sectional value function at that surface would be the $r$ component of our value function $\vec{F}$: $\vec{F_r}$. Hence, the flux expression is:

\begin{equation}
   \iint_{S_1} F_r\left(r + \frac{\Delta r}{2}, \theta, z\right) \left(r+ \frac{\Delta r}{2}\right) \Delta \theta \Delta z
\end{equation}

The opposite direction ("inside" the cylinder), is simply the negative of the value function and direction (i.e. adding $\Delta r$ in the opposite direction).

\begin{equation}
   \iint_{S_2} -F_r\left(r - \frac{\Delta r}{2}, \theta, z\right) \left(r- \frac{\Delta r}{2}\right) \Delta \theta \Delta z
\end{equation}

In total, the expression of the two values added would be:

\begin{equation}
    F_r\left(r + \frac{\Delta r}{2}, \theta, z\right) \left(r+ \frac{\Delta r}{2}\right) \Delta \theta \Delta z-F_r\left(r - \frac{\Delta r}{2}, \theta, z\right) \left(r- \frac{\Delta r}{2}\right) \Delta \theta \Delta z
\end{equation}

Finally, to calculate the desired divergence at that point, we will divide the resulted by $\frac{1}{\Delta V} = \frac{1}{\Delta \theta \Delta z r\Delta r}$

Therefore, the expression becomes:

\begin{equation}
    \frac{1}{r\Delta r} \left[F_r\left(r + \frac{\Delta r}{2}, \theta, z\right) \left(r+ \frac{\Delta r}{2}\right) -F_r\left(r - \frac{\Delta r}{2}, \theta, z\right) \left(r- \frac{\Delta r}{2}\right) \right]
\end{equation}

Lastly, we will take the limit as $\Delta r$ (i.e. $\Delta V$) approaches zero. We will do this in three steps:

First, we will factor out the $\frac{1}{r}$ component: 

\begin{align}
    &\frac{1}{r \Delta r} \left[F_r\left(r + \frac{\Delta r}{2}, \theta, z\right) \left(r+ \frac{\Delta r}{2}\right) -F_r\left(r - \frac{\Delta r}{2}, \theta, z\right) \left(r- \frac{\Delta r}{2}\right) \right]\\
\Rightarrow &\ \frac{1}{r} \frac{\left[F_r\left(r + \frac{\Delta r}{2}, \theta, z\right)r - F_r\left(r - \frac{\Delta r}{2}, \theta, z\right)r \right]}{\Delta r} \\
\Rightarrow &\ \frac{1}{r} \frac{\partial}{\partial r} (rF_r)
\end{align}

Expanding over each dimension, therefore:

\begin{equation}
   div\ \vec{F} = \frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial}{\partial r}(rF_r) + \frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial F_{\theta}}{\partial \theta} + \frac{\partial F_{z}}{\partial z} 
\end{equation}

And hence, divergence in cylindrical coordinates work in exactly the same way as that in rectangular ones.

* Spherical Coordinates
We will apply a similar reasoning to prove the flux/divergence in spherical coordinates. Most of the content here is functionally equivalent.

We will first create the conception of a "spherical cuboid". It is essentially the same idea as the cylindrical cuboid, but the flat edge is now curved downwards to become a sectional sphere.

The front edge and back edges can be modeled very similarly as before. Except the $r\pm\frac{\Delta r}{2}$ terms are squared in order to accommodate for the new $\Delta \theta$ and $\Delta \phi$ terms (i.e. we need to find "circumference" on both.

The proposed center is still at its original position, that:

\begin{equation}
   \left(r+\frac{r}{2},\theta,\phi\right)
\end{equation}

The logic carries from before of the same calculation of flux: the value function along the $r$ direction, multiplied by the area of the surface cross-section. The logic would be almost exactly the same, except the "radius" section is squared as there are two angles for which the "circumference" that makes up the area of cross-section is calculated.

In total, the expression of the two values added would be:

\begin{equation}
    F_r\left(r + \frac{\Delta r}{2}, \theta, z\right) \left(r+ \frac{\Delta r}{2}\right)^2 \Delta \theta \Delta \phi-F_r\left(r - \frac{\Delta r}{2}, \theta, z\right) \left(r- \frac{\Delta r}{2}\right)^2 \Delta \theta \Delta \phi
\end{equation}

Dividing the expression by $\Delta V$ and taking the limit, as with the definition from before, then:

\begin{align}
&\frac{F_r\left(r + \frac{\Delta r}{2}, \theta, z\right) \left(r+ \frac{\Delta r}{2}\right)^2 -F_r\left(r - \frac{\Delta r}{2}, \theta, z\right) \left(r- \frac{\Delta r}{2}\right)^2}{r \Delta r} \\
\Rightarrow &\frac{1}{r} \frac{F_r\left(r + \frac{\Delta r}{2}, \theta, z\right) \left(r+ \frac{\Delta r}{2}\right)^2 -F_r\left(r - \frac{\Delta r}{2}, \theta, z\right) \left(r- \frac{\Delta r}{2}\right)^2}{\Delta r} \\
\end{align}
We will finally take the limit as $\Delta r \to 0$, applying the same logic as before that the expression forms the formal definition of a derivative $\frac{\partial F_r}{\partial r}$ multiplied by $r$ (as $\frac{\Delta r}{2} = 0$) twice. Therefore, the final expression in the $r$ direction is:

\begin{equation}
   \frac{1}{r^2}\frac{\partial}{\partial r} (r^2F_f)
\end{equation}

The same logic follows for all other directions, though the area for $r$ value is replaced by $\sin{\{\theta,\phi\}}$ as we are looking for a /length/ and not an /angle/.

The final expression, therefore, for spherical coordinates:

\begin{equation}
   \frac{1}{r^2}\frac{\partial}{\partial r} (r^2F_f) + \frac{1}{r\sin{\phi}}\frac{\partial}{\partial \phi}(\sin \phiF_{\phi})+\frac{1}{r\sin\phi}\frac{\partial F_\theta}{\partial \theta}
\end{equation}
