* Precessional Velocity
Taking the setup, we can figure the sum of the angular momentums and leverage it to figure the spin angular momentum.

Let's first define a system: $\hat{i}$ is "right" on the figure, $\hat{j}$ "in" the page, $\hat{k}$ "up" the figure.

We note that the normal spin of the flywheel gives us:

\begin{equation}
   \vec{L}_s = I\vec{\omega}_s \hat{i}
\end{equation}

As the flywheel is rotating at a constant speed, we have actually no torque that this contributes to the net system --- that is $\frac{d\vec{L}_s}{dt} = 0$. 

Furthermore, we can figure torque---and subsequent angular momentum contribution---of gravity as follows:

\begin{equation}
    \vec{\tau}_g = lmg \hat{j}
\end{equation}

The total net torque on the system, then:

\begin{align}
   \vec{\tau}_{net} &= \vec{\tau}_g + 0 \\
&= \vec{\tau}_g
\end{align}

We also have that:

\begin{equation}
   \vec{\tau}_{net} = \frac{\vec{L}_{net}}{dt} = \Delta \vec{L}_s = lmg
\end{equation}

We see that, because of small-angle approximation, $\Delta \vec{L}_s = L_s \Omega$

Therefore, we can replace the values determined above and solve for $\Omega$:

\begin{align}
    &\Delta \vec{L}_s = L_s \Omega\\
\Rightarrow\ & lmg = I\vec{\omega}_s \Omega\\
\Rightarrow\ & \Omega = \frac{lmg}{I\vec{\omega}_s}
\end{align}
