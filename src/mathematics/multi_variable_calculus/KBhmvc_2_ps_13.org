We first graph the expression.

#+begin_quote
Find an area under the straight line from $(1,2)$ to $(4,7)$.
#+end_quote

The line has slope $\frac{5}{3}$. We will begin by solving for its $y$ intercept.

\begin{align}
   &2 = \frac{5}{3} + b\\
&b = \frac{1}{3}
\end{align}

Therefore, the expression from which we are slicing is:

\begin{equation}
   y = \frac{5}{3} x + \frac{1}{3} 
\end{equation}

From here, we will now actually perform the parameterization.

\begin{equation}
\begin{align}
&x = t\\
&y = \frac{5}{3} t + \frac{1}{3}    
\end{align}
\end{equation}

#+begin_src sage
f(x,y) = y*e^x
contour_plot(f, (x,-5,5), (y,-5,5), cmap="cool")+plot((5/3)*x+(1/3), (-3,3))
#+end_src

Our bounds are $(1,2)$ to $(4,7)$, meaning the bounds are from $[1,4]$ in units of $t$.

Additionally, we will figure the rate of change of the action function w.r.t. both of these variables:

\begin{align}
   \frac{dx}{dt} &= 1 \\
   \frac{dy}{dt} &= \frac{5}{3} 
\end{align}

Therefore, the actual function $\frac{df}{dt}$ grows at a rate of:

\begin{align}
   \frac{df}{dt} &= \sqrt{1 + \left(\frac{5}{3}\right)^2}\\
&= \sqrt{1 + \frac{25}{9}}\\
&= \sqrt{\frac{34}{9}}
\end{align}

Now we are ready to parameterize this function.

\begin{align}
   &f(x,y) = ye^x \\
\Rightarrow &f\left(t, \frac{5}{3}t+\frac{1}{3}\right) = \left(\frac{5}{3}t+\frac{1}{3}\right) e^t
\end{align}

The actual integral, scaled correctly to the units originally in the function, therefore is:

\begin{equation}
   \int^4_1 = \left(\frac{5}{3}t+\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)\right)e^t\sqrt(\frac{34}{9})
\end{equation}

#+begin_src sage
from sage.symbolic.integration.integral import definite_integral

float(definite_integral(((5/3)*t+(1/3))*e^t*sqrt(34/9), t, 1, 4))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 564.2107568527322

It is roughly $564.2$ units across.

* Line integral problem 2
#+begin_quote
Consider the parabaloid:

\begin{equation}
f(x,y) = x^2 + y^2    
\end{equation}

Find the area under this function, along a circle of radius 1 centered at the origin.
#+end_quote

#+begin_src sage
f(x,y) = x^2 + y^2
plot3d(f, (x,-5,5), (y,-5,5))

We are to parameterize this function along a circle of radius 1, some equation:

\begin{equation}
   x^2 + y^2 = 1 
\end{equation}

We will parameterize the function along a circle:

\begin{align}
   &y = sin(t)\\
&x = cos(t)
\end{align}

#+begin_src sage
f(x,y) = x^2 + y^2
contour_plot(f, (x,-5,5), (y,-5,5), cmap="cool")+implicit_plot(x^2+y^2-1, (-5,5), (-5,5))
#+end_src

Evidently, the pairs $y,x$ form a valid pair of parameterization to the above expression.

Furthermore, we need to figure $\frac{df}{dt}$. As per the Pythagorean theorem again, $\frac{df}{dt}$ is $1$ as the derivatives of sine, cosine, squared, would simply result in $sin^2t + cos^2t = 1$.

We will supply the parameterization now to the function:

\begin{align}
   &f(x,y) = x^2 + y^2 \\
&f(cos(t),sin(t)) = 1
\end{align}

We lastly take the very simple integral:

\begin{align}
   &\int^{2\pi}_0 = 1 dt \\
\Rightarrow &2\pi
\end{align}

* Seal Sweatshop 
As per given by the question, our revenue $R$ is modeled by the following function:

\begin{equation}
   R(h,s) = 200 h^{2/3} s^{1/3} 
\end{equation}

Our bound function is that we only have $20,000$ to spend on the expenses. Each raccoonhour of work costs 20 dollars, and sear furs which cost $170$ per unit. 

Therefore, the maximum expense expression (the bounds) would therefore be:

\begin{equation}
   g(h,s)=170s+20h-20000
\end{equation}

Solutions to $g$ on $R$ would therefore be our desired solution.

We first take the gradient of $g$:

\begin{equation}
   \nabla g = \begin{pmatrix}
20 \\170
\end{pmatrix} 
\end{equation}

We will furthermore take the gradient of $R$:

\begin{align}
   \nabla R &= \begin{pmatrix}
200S^{\frac{1}{3}}\frac{2}{3}h^{\frac{-1}{3}}\\
200h^{\frac{2}{3}}\frac{1}{3}S^{\frac{-2}{3}}
\end{pmatrix} \\
&= \begin{pmatrix}
\frac{400}{3} \sqrt[3]{\frac{s}{h}}\\
\frac{200}{3} \sqrt[3]{\frac{h^2}{s^2}}
\end{pmatrix}
\end{align}

Given the expression for Lagrange multipliers, we can finally set up a system of three equations and solve:

\begin{equation}
   \begin{cases}
 \frac{400}{3} \sqrt[3]{\frac{s}{h}} = \lambda 20 \\   
\frac{200}{3} \sqrt[3]{\frac{h^2}{s^2}} = \lambda 170\\
170s+20h-20000=0
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

We now solve using Sage:

#+begin_src sage
s,h,l = var("s h l", domain="real")
eqns = [
    ((400/3)*(s/h)^(1/3) == l*20),
    ((200/3)*((h^2)/(s^2))^(1/3) == l*170),
    170*s + 20*h - 20000 == 0
]

solve(eqns, s,h,l)
#+end_src

Therefore, we understand that, to maximize revenue, we will use $s=\frac{2000}{51}$ tonnes of fur and $h=\frac{2000}{3}$ hours of work. This will result in approximately $51854.8$ dollars of revenue.

* 1D Taylor Series
Let's set our initial speed at $x$, to travel some fixed distance $d$.

This means that our generic expression for time elapsed is:

\begin{align}
   tx = d \\
t = \frac{d}{x} 
\end{align}

If we, say, now increased our speed by a factor of $(1+100\%) = 2$, we can figure a new expression for time:

\begin{align}
   t' &= \frac{d}{2x} \\
&=\frac{1}{2} \frac{d}{x}
\end{align}

If increased speed by $100\%$, we only get there in half as much time (i.e. lowered time by $50\%$).

** Increasing speed by $50\%$
If we instead increased speed by $50\%$, we will increase it by a factor of $(1+50\%) = 1.5$. By the same token, therefore:

\begin{align}
   t' &= \frac{d}{1.5x} \\
&= \frac{10}{15}\frac{d}{x} \\
&= \frac{2}{3}\frac{d}{x}
\end{align}

We will get there in $\frac{2}{3}$ the original time. As it took originally 6 hours, it would take now roughly 4 hours, lowering time by $33.\overline{3}\%$.

** Increasing a speed at small intervals
If we increased our speed by $2\%$, we will increase it by a factor of $(1+2\%) = 1.02$.

As with before:

\begin{align}
   t' &= \frac{d}{1.02x} \\
&= \frac{100}{102}\frac{d}{x} \\
&= \frac{50}{51}\frac{d}{x}
\end{align}

We will get there in $\frac{50}{51}$ of the original time. It will take roughly $5.88$ hours. This would constitute lowering time by $1.96\% \approx 2\%$.

** The Taylor Series
As we can see from the expression of:

\begin{equation}
   t' = \frac{1}{\sigma} \frac{d}{x} 
\end{equation}

repeatedly used above, where $\sigma$ is some factor of speed increase, the actual weight of the speed increase is:

\begin{equation}
   1- \frac{1}{\sigma} 
\end{equation}

As we know, the Taylor Series centered at $1$ (doing nothing) for $\frac{1}{x}$ is:

\begin{equation}
    \frac{1}{x} = 1-(x-1)+(x-1)^2 -(x-1)^3 \cdots
\end{equation}

Subtracting this whole expression by 1, therefore:

\begin{equation}
    1-\frac{1}{x} = (x-1)-(x-1)^2 +(x-1)^3 \cdots
\end{equation}

We therefore see that, at values close to 1, this expression holds a roughly linear relation (first degree of the Taylor Series is most augmented; the rest, due to squaring/cubing/etc., is more diminished.) As $x$ gets larger, the weight of the rest of the sequence becomes larger --- pairwise balancing to have a more reduced effect on the speed.
