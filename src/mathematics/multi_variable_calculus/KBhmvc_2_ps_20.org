* Triangle Bottom 
Let's plot the region first:

#+begin_src sage
f(x,y) = e^x
plot3d(f, (x, -2, 2), (y, -2,2))
#+end_src

We can see that the shape is symmetric along the $y$ axis. Hence, a triangle along it would be symmetric and divide an area under exactly by half. Therefore, we can simply take the integral $x,y \in [0,1]$, and divide the result by half.

\begin{align}
&\int_0^1 \int_0^1 e^x\ dx\ dy\\
\Rightarrow &\int_0^1 e-1\ dy\\
\Rightarrow &\left ey-y\ \right|_0^1\\
\Rightarrow &e-1
\end{align}

The area under the prescribed triangle, then, would be:

\begin{equation}
   \frac{e-1}{2} 
\end{equation}

* Polar Function
Take the function:

\begin{equation}
   f(x,y) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}} 
\end{equation}

#+begin_src sage
f(x,y) = 1/sqrt(x^2+y^2)
plot3d(f, (x,-5,5), (y,-5,5))
#+end_src

Evidently, it is actually much easier to manipulate this shape in polar form (note the bottom squaring-and-add). As a reminder, the parameterization into polar is as follows:

\begin{equation}
\begin{cases}
y = r\ sin(\theta)\\
x = r\ cos(\theta)
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

Supplying these parameterizations:

\begin{align}
   &f(x,y) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}} \\
\Rightarrow &f(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{(r\ cos(\theta))^2+(r\ sin(\theta))^2}} \\
\Rightarrow &f(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{r^2(cos^2(\theta)+sin^2(\theta))}} \\
\Rightarrow &f(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{r^2}} \\
\Rightarrow &f(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{|r|} 
\end{align}

We are going to be integrating over $[0,2\pi]$, a circle, of radius 1 $[0,1]$. We will note that these values never approaches being negative, making the absolute value have no utility.

When integrating over a radius, we also note that change in theta $d\theta$ must be multiplied by $r$ to get the circumference on each ring. $\frac{r}{|r|}$, therefore---given that the values never approach negative---we have $\frac{r}{|r|} = 1$.

Therefore, taking the actual integral:

\begin{align}
   &\int_0^1 \int_0^{2\pi} 1\ d\theta\ dr\\
\Rightarrow & \int_0^1 2\pi\ dr\\
\Rightarrow & 2\pi
\end{align}

* Rose
Taking the actual rose, and plotting it first:

#+begin_src sage
r(theta) = cos(4*theta)
polar_plot(r, (theta, 0, 2*pi))
#+end_src

Observing the shape, and the domain of $cos$ being $[-1,1]$, we can see that the diametre of the flower is $2$ inches.

I am not quite sure what the surface area of the expression in $\mathbb{R}^1\to\mathbb{R}^1$ means, but one possible solution would be the total area of the pedals, times two---resulting in both sides.

We know that, for instance, $cos(\theta)=0$ when $\theta =\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{3\pi}{2}$. Therefore, $cos(4\theta)$ would be $0$ when $\theta = \frac{\pi}{8}, \frac{3\pi}{8}$. This lines up with the lower-right pedal.

Let's take the integral, then:

\begin{align}
   &\int_{\frac{\pi}{8}}^{\frac{3\pi}{8}} cos(4\theta)\ d\theta\\
\Rightarrow &\left\frac{1}{2}sin(4\theta)\right|_{\frac{\pi}{8}}^{\frac{3\pi}{8}}\\
\Rightarrow &-0.5-0.5\\
\Rightarrow &-1
\end{align}

The negative value simply indicates its below the $x$ axis, but each pedal has an area of $1$.
Multiplying this value by the number of pedals $8$, we have a total area of $8$ on one side.

Multiplying this again by $2$ to account for both sides, we have $16$ square inches as the surface area of the entire flower.
