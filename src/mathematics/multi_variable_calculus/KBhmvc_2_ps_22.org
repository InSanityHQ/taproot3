* Why be a king, when you can be a God?
We are going to take a definite integral across all of infinity by three dimensions.

\begin{equation}
   e(x,y,z) = \frac{1}{7^{(x^2+y^2+z^2)^{\frac{3}{2}}}}
\end{equation}

Given that universes are spheres and its far easier to take the spherical units here, we will take this integral with spherical coordinates.

We realize that $x^2+y^2+z^2 = {\rho}^2$ in spherical space by pythagoras. Hence:

\begin{align}
   e(\rho, \theta, \phi) &= \frac{1}{7^{\rho^2^{\frac{3}{2}}}} \\
&= \frac{1}{7^{\rho^3}} 
\end{align}

We note that, to calculate $dV$, we have $dV = \rho^2\ sin\theta\ d\phi\ d\theta\ d\rho$.

Taking the actual $dV$, then:

\begin{equation}
   \iiint_V \frac{\rho^2\ \sin\theta}{7^{\rho^3}} \ d\phi\ d\theta\ d\rho
\end{equation}

Evidently, its time for $u$ sub:

\begin{align}
   &u = \rho^3 \\
&\frac{du}{d\rho} = 3\rho^2 \\
&du = 3\rho^2\ d\rho
\end{align}

And hence:

\begin{equation}
   \iiint_V \frac{\sin\theta}{7^{u}} \ d\phi\ d\theta\ du
\end{equation}

We will take bounds by $[0, \pi]$, first against $\phi$:

\begin{align}
   &\int_0^\pi \frac{\sin\theta}{7^{u}} \ d\phi\\
\Rightarrow &\frac{\pi\sin\theta}{7^{u}} 
\end{align}

Great, we will now take the integral by $\theta$, again by bounds $[0,\pi]$:

\begin{align}
   &\int_0^\pi \frac{\sin\theta}{7^{u}} \ d\theta\\
\Rightarrow &\frac{-\pi\cos\pi}{7^{u}} \\
\Rightarrow &\frac{\pi}{7^{u}} 
\end{align}

And finally, we take the integral $du$ from infinity:

\begin{align}
   &\int_0^\infty \frac{\pi}{7^{u}}\ du\\
\Rightarrow & \pi\int_0^\infty \frac{1}{7^{u}}\ du\\
\Rightarrow & \pi\int_0^\infty {7^{-u}}\ du\\
\Rightarrow & \left-\pi\ \frac{1}{7^x\ ln(7)}\right|_0^\infty \\
\Rightarrow & \frac{\pi}{ln(7)} 
\end{align}

Multiplying the spherical result by $2$ (we got half the circle), we get that the final energy is:

\begin{equation}
   \frac{2\pi}{ln(7)} 
\end{equation}

The actual universe has net energy of $0$ because its an infinitely large system with no external energy sources (as far as we know).

* Area of a Circle
We can essentially leverage the polar expression:

\begin{equation}
   \iint_A \ dA 
\end{equation}

In practice, this looks like:

\begin{align}
   &\int_0^r \int_0^{2\pi} r\ d\theta\ dr\\
\Rightarrow &\int_0^r 2\pi r\ dr\\
\Rightarrow & 2\pi \frac{r^2}{2}\\
\Rightarrow & \pi r^2\ \blacksquare
\end{align}

It looks like a little lantern!

We will first convert all of the system into a cylindrical system:

the sphere:

\begin{equation}
   r^2 + z^2 \leq 1 
\end{equation}

and, the cylinder:

\begin{equation}
   r = \frac{1}{2}
\end{equation}

We can see that our sphere is between $[-1,1]$ in all directions. Furthermore, our cylinder is cut in the middle.

For every slice, it contains an area of:

\begin{equation}
   \pi\ (r(h))^2\ dh 
\end{equation}

where, $r(h)$ is a function in $h$ which maps the radius. We will note now that a large sphere is made of small concentric spheres. At every disk, a sphere's $h$ (radius by height) would be the same as its $r$ (radius by width). 

Hence, we have: 

\begin{equation}
   \pi h^2\ dh 
\end{equation}

for every disk.

We furthermore have a tiny cut-out in the middle of the shape, of a cylinder of height $dh$ and area $\pi r^2 = \frac{\pi}{4}$.

For every disk, with the cut-out, then:

\begin{equation}
   \pi h^2\ dh - \frac{\pi}{4}\ dh
\end{equation}

We finally perform the integration:

\begin{align}
    &\int_{-1}^{1} \pi h^2\ dh - \frac{\pi}{4}\ dh\\
\Rightarrow\ &\left\left( \frac{h^3\pi}{3} - \frac{h\pi}{4}\right)\right|_{-1}^{1}\\
\Rightarrow\ &\frac{2\pi}{3} -\frac{2\pi}{4}
\end{align}

* Volcano Volume

** General volcano
To figure the volume of the shape $f(x,y) = \frac{1}{(x^2+y^2)^k}$. 

We will convert this system into polar form again for the ease of computation. Recall again that, by pythagoras, $x^2+y^2 = r^2$.

Hence:

\begin{equation}
   f(r,\theta) = \frac{1}{r^{2k}} 
\end{equation}

We will again take the integral, with ranges $r=[0,1], \theta=[0,2\pi]$ from before, and $dA=r\ dr\ d\theta$:

\begin{align}
&\int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^1 r^{-k}\ dr\ d\theta\\
\Rightarrow &\int_0^{2\pi} \lim_{x\to 0} \left(\frac{1}{-k+1}-\frac{1}{x^{k-1}}\frac{1}{-k+1}\right)\ d\theta
\end{align}

Evidently, when $k\leq 1$, the second term would become infinity large.

** 1D Volcano
We will take the same integral again, but in 1-d. We realize that $\frac{1}{x}=ln(x)$, so, we have two cases:

Case 1: $k \neq 1$

\begin{align}
   &\int_{-1}^1 x^{-k} dx\\
\Rightarrow &\frac{1}{-k+1}-\frac{{-1}^{-k+1}}{-k+1} 
\end{align}

where the value shifts between a real value for odd negative $k$, and even for even negative $k$.

Case 2: $k=1$

\begin{align}
   &\int_{-1}^1 x^{-1} dx\\
\Rightarrow &\left ln(x) \right|_{-1}^1
\end{align}

Where, the second value would tend towards $+\infty$. 

Hence, when $k=1$, the second term would become infinity large.
