We are finally taking a surface integral! This is essentially multiplying the surface area of the shape of the function to the value of the function itself.

Firstly, taking the area $dA$ by $dV$:

\begin{align}
   dA &= \sqrt{1+\left(\frac{\partial z}{\partial x}\right)^2+\left(\frac{\partial z}{\partial y}\right)^2} \\
&= 1
\end{align}
