* Evaluating a Cylindrical Integral 
#+begin_quote
Considering the function: 

\begin{equation}
   f(x,y,z) = \sqrt{x^2+y^2} 
\end{equation}
#+end_quote

To evaluate the integral, we will convert it to cylindrical coordinates. We note first that the integral is to be evaluated inside the cylinder of $x^2+y^2 = 16$, which means that we wish to evaluate it in a circle with center at the origin with radius $4$.

Furthermore, we understand that the bounds of the function are to be evaluated between $[-5, -4]$.

If we set up the integral, we will get:

\begin{equation}
   \int_{-5}^{-4} \int_C\ \sqrt{x^2+y^2}\ dx\ dy\ dz 
\end{equation}

This is convenient. We can evaluate the inner integral first like in $\mathbb{R}^2\to\mathbb{R}^1$, then simply evaluate the other integral after.

Let's do so.

Note that the inner integral is a normal cylindrical choordinate.
