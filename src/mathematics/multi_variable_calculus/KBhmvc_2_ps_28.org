* Evaluating a Cylindrical Integral 
#+begin_quote
Considering the function: 

\begin{equation}
   f(x,y,z) = \sqrt{x^2+y^2} 
\end{equation}
#+end_quote

To evaluate the integral, we will convert it to cylindrical coordinates. We note first that the integral is to be evaluated inside the cylinder of $x^2+y^2 = 16$, which means that we wish to evaluate it in a circle with center at the origin with radius $4$.

Furthermore, we understand that the bounds of the function are to be evaluated between $[-5, -4]$.
