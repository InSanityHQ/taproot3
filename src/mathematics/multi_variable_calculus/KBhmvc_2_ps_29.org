* A surface integral
We are defining a function:

\begin{equation}
   f(x,y,z) = y^2 
\end{equation}

and slicing out a vertical organ pipe shape with a sliced edge. That is:

\begin{equation}
   x^2 + z^2 = 1 
\end{equation}

bounded by $y>0$ and $y<3-x$.

Let's plot this:

#+begin_src sage
var('x,y,z')
f = y^2

implicit_plot3d(x^2+z^2 == 1, (y,-1,1), (x,-1,1), (z, -1,1), region=(lambda x,y,z: y > 0 and y<3-x), color=(f,colormaps.cool))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: (x, y, z)

that's honestly pretty cool!

Great, now let's take the actual surface integral.

Looking at the actual function for which we are taking the integral, we have:

\begin{equation}
   x^2 + z^2 = 1 
\end{equation}

We will rearrange this expression in terms of $z$:

\begin{equation}
   z = \sqrt{1-x^2}
\end{equation}

Fortunately, we see already that the function's derivative w.r.t. $y$ is $0$; indeed, it doesn't change along the $y$ direction (the cylinder is centered around it after all.)

Taking the derivative in the $x$ direction:

\begin{align}
   \frac{\partial z}{\partial x} &= \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \sqrt{1-x^2} \\
&= \frac{-2x}{2\sqrt{-x^2+1}}\\
&= \frac{-x}{\sqrt{-x^2+1}}
\end{align}

Squaring the expression below:

\begin{equation}
\frac{x^2}{-x^2+1}
\end{equation}

And finally, we have the correction factor:

\begin{align}
    dA &= \sqrt{\frac{x^2}{-x^2+1} + 1}\ dV\\
&= \sqrt{\frac{1}{-x^2+1}}\ dV
\end{align}

Lastly, we can multiply the actual value function to this to this expression to get the expression for the integral:

\begin{equation}
   \iint_V\ y^2\ \sqrt{\frac{1}{-x^2+1}}\ dx\ dy
\end{equation}
