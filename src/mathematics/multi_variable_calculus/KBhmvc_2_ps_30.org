* Jacobian Determinant for Polar
We are to determine (pun not intended) the polar correction factor for a double integral, $dA= r\ dr\ d\theta$.

To do this, we will have to first figure the change of bases expressions such that we can take:

\begin{equation}
   f(x,y) = g(r, \theta) 
\end{equation}

Fortunately, this is already derived to use from before.

\begin{equation}
   \begin{cases}
   x = r\cos\theta \\
   y = r\sin\theta \\
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

Therefore, we have that:

\begin{equation}
   f(x,y) = f(r\cos\theta, r\sin\theta) 
\end{equation}

And therefore, we can figure $J_{r,\theta}$:

\begin{equation}
   J = \begin{bmatrix} 
cos\theta & -r\sin\theta \\
sin\theta & r\cos\theta \\
\end{bmatrix} 
\end{equation}

Taking its determinant, then:

\begin{equation}
   det(J) = r\cos^2\theta +r\sin^2\theta = r
\end{equation}

And therefore, the change-of-basis result would be:

\begin{equation}
   dx\ dy = r\ dr\ d\theta 
\end{equation}

* Jacobian Determinant for Spherical
We again need to figure a correction factor for $dx\ dy\ dz = \rho^2\ \sin\phi\ d\rho\ d\theta\ d\phi$.

We therefore have to figur ea change of bases
