* Parametric Equations
#+begin_quote
Consider the curve described by the following parametric equations:

\begin{align}
    x(t) = t^2 \\
    y(t) = t^3 - ct, {c \in \mathbb{R}}
\end{align}

#+end_quote

** Rectangular Equations
#+begin_quote
Come up with function --- functions, rather --- for this curve. In other words, convert it to rectangular form.
#+end_quote

Given $x(t) = t^2$, we could figure that $t = \sqrt{x}$. As such, replacing for the definition of $t$ in the second statement, we could derive that:

\begin{align}
    y(t) =& t^3 - ct \\
\Rightarrow y(t) =& (\pm \sqrt{x})^3 - c(\pm \sqrt{x}) \\
=& \pm x\sqrt{x} \pm  c\sqrt{x} \\
=& \pm \sqrt{x} (x - c)
\end{align}

** Particle path and length
#+begin_quote
Imagine if you are a little particle on this curve, traveling from $t=5$ to $t=7$. What is your path, and what's the total distance you travel?
#+end_quote

*** Start position
\begin{align}
    x(5) = 5^2 = 25 \\
    y(5) = 5^3 - 5c = 125 - 5c
\end{align}

Setting $c=1$, we derive that...

\begin{align}
    x(5) = 25 \\
    y(5) = 120
\end{align}

Hence, the start position of the particle is $(25,120)$.

*** End position
\begin{align}
    x(7) = 7^2 = 49 \\
    y(7) = 7^3 - 7 = 336
\end{align}

Hence, the end position of the particle is $(49,336)$

*** Direction of Travel
The middle point of the travel is at $t = \frac{12}{2} = 6$.

The derivatives of the parameter equations are as follows: 

\begin{align}
x'(t) = 2t \\
y'(t) = 3t^2-c
\end{align}

Therefore, the derivative in the direction of the particle travel is:

\begin{equation}
    \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{3t^2-c}{2t}
\end{equation}

At $c=1$ and $t=6$, the value is therefore:

\begin{equation}
    \frac{108-1}{12} \approx 8.9
\end{equation}

As the value of the derivative is positive --- that as x increases, y increases, we know that at $t=8$ the particle is traveling in a positive direction as $x$ increases.

*** Total Distance of Travel
To figure the distance of travel, we need to apply the following expression for arc length:

\begin{align}
     \int_{t=5}^{t=7} & \sqrt{(\frac{dx}{dt})^2 + (\frac{dy}{dt})^2} dt \\
     \int_{t=5}^{t=7} & \sqrt{(2t)^2 + (3t^2-c)^2} dt 
\end{align}

At this point, we set $c=0$ as an example value.

\begin{align}
    \int_{t=5}^{t=7} & \sqrt{(2t)^2 + (3t^2)^2} dt  \\
    \int_{t=5}^{t=7} & \sqrt{4t^2 + 9t^4} dt  \\
    \int_{t=5}^{t=7} & \sqrt{t^2(4 + 9t^2)} dt  \\
    \int_{t=5}^{t=7} & t \sqrt{(4 + 9t^2)} dt 
\end{align}

We now perform u-sub upon this problem to figure the final solution.

\begin{align}
    Let\ u=(4+9t^2)\\
\frac{du}{dt} = 18t \\
dt = \frac{1}{18t}du 
\end{align}

\begin{align}
    \frac{1}{18} \int_{t=5}^{t=7} & u^{\frac{1}{2}} du \\
    \frac{1}{18} & (\frac{u^{\frac{3}{2}}}{\frac{3}{2}} \mid^3_2) \\
    \frac{1}{18} & (\frac{2\sqrt{u^3}}{3} \mid^3_2) \\
    \frac{1}{18} & (\frac{2\sqrt{(4+9t^2)^3}}{3} \mid^3_2) \\
    \frac{1}{18} & ((\frac{2\sqrt{(4+9(3^2))^3}}{3}) - 
 (\frac{2\sqrt{(4+9(2^2))^3}}{3})) \approx 19.65 \\
\end{align}
The particle travels about $19.65$ units.

* Solids of Revolution 
#+begin_quote
Consider the shape made by taking the function $f(x) = \frac{1}{x}$ from $x=1$ out to $\infty$ by spinning it around the x-axis.
#+end_quote

** Surface Area
The surface area of the resulting shape could be deducted by applying the circumference formula for circles produced by rotation. That is ---

\begin{align}
    & 2\pi \int_1^\infty \frac{1}{x} dx \\
    \Rightarrow & 2\pi \lim_{b \to \infty} (ln(x) \mid^b_1) dx  \\
    \Rightarrow & \infty
\end{align}

** Volume
The volume calculation is much the same (though, with dramatically different results at infinity), except that the "radius" of the circles are squared and multiplied to $\pi$ to produce the area of each circular slice.

\begin{align}
    & 2\pi \int_1^\infty x^{-2} dx \\
    \Rightarrow & \pi \lim_{b \to \infty} \frac{-1}{x} \mid^b_1 dx  \\
    \Rightarrow & -\pi
\end{align}

* Partial Derivatives

** $f(x,y) = 7x+2x^2y^3+10y^2$

\begin{align}
    f_x =& 7 + 4xy^3 \\
    f_y =& 6x^2y^2 + 20y \\
    f_{xx} =& 4y^3 \\
    f_{yy} =& 12x^2y + 20 \\
    f_{xy} =& 12xy^2 \\
    f_{xxx} =& 0 \\
    f_{yyy} =& 12x^2 \\
    f_{xxy} =& 12y^2 \\
    f_{yyx} =& 24yx 
\end{align}

** $f(x_y) = 3xy^3+8x^2y^4$

\begin{align}
    f_x =& 3y^3 + 16xy^4 \\
    f_y =& 9xy^2 + 32x^2y^3 \\
    f_{xx} =& 16y^4 \\
    f_{yy} =& 18xy + 96x^2y^2 \\
    f_{xy} =& 9y^2 + 64xy^3 \\
    f_{xxx} =& 0 \\
    f_{yyy} =& 18x + 192x^2y \\
    f_{xxy} =& 64y^3 \\
    f_{yyx} =& 18y + 192xy^2 \\
\end{align}
