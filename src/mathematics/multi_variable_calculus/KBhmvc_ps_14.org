* Jacobian Derivative Matrix 

** $f(x,y) = \frac{xy}{x^2+y^2}$
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = \frac{(x^2+y^2) y - xy(2x)}{(x^2+y^2)^2}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = \frac{(x^2+y^2)x - xy(2y)}{(x^2+y^2)^2}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    f'(x,y) = \begin{bmatrix}
\frac{(x^2+y^2) y - xy(2x)}{(x^2+y^2)^2} \\
\frac{(x^2+y^2)x - xy(2y)}{(x^2+y^2)^2}
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

** $f(x,y,z) = [xy+2yz,2x^2y^2]$
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial f^0}{\partial x} = y
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial f^1}{\partial x} = 4xy^2
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial f^0}{\partial y} = x+2z
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial f^1}{\partial y} = 4yx^2
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    f'(x,y,z) = \begin{bmatrix}
y & x+2z \\
4xy^2 & 4yx^2 
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

* Total First Derivatives
#+begin_quote
Suppose you have a function $\mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^1$, how many total first partial derivatives does it have? What about second partial derivatives? ... What about k'th partial derivatives.
#+end_quote

For a function $\mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^1$, it has $2$ first partial derivatives, $3$ second partial derivatives, $4$ third partial derivatives, and $k+1$ k-th partial derivatives.

* Multi-Variable Slopes
\begin{equation}

\begin{equation}
    f_x = 7+4xy^3
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    f_y = 6x^2y^2 + 20y
\end{equation}


** Steepness of function at $[-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}, \frac{1}{2}]$
The gradient at the $(1,2)$, as a vector, is $[39, 64]$

*** Steepness of the Function at Point
Projecting that onto the direction of $[-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}, \frac{1}{2}]$ would result in:

\begin{equation}
\begin{bmatrix}
39 \\ 64
\end{bmatrix} \cdot
\begin{bmatrix}
-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\\ \frac{1}{2}
\end{bmatrix} = 
\frac{64-39\sqrt{3}}{2}
\end{equation}

Hence, $\frac{64-39\sqrt{3}}{2}$ is the "slope" of the function at $(1,2)$ facing $[-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}, \frac{1}{2}]$. The angle of which the slope represents, therefore, would be $arctan(\frac{64-39\sqrt{3}}{2}) \approx -60.60^{\circ}$. 

** Optimizing for steepness
We want to figure an angle $\theta$ such that the gradient would be most steep, that is, a $\theta$ such that...

\begin{equation}
    39cos{\theta} + 64sin{\theta}
\end{equation}

is maximized. We know that there exists a $\theta_{max}$ such that this expression would be maximized, meaning that if there exists a critical point for this expression we would arrive as such an optima.

The derivative w.r.t. $\theta$ of the expression above is

\begin{equation}
   -39 sin \theta + 64 cos \theta
\end{equation}

Solving for a value of that expression at $0$ to arrive at a critical point,

\begin{align}
   & 64 cos \theta = 0 \\
   \Rightarrow\ &64 cos \theta = 39 sin \theta  \\
   \Rightarrow\ &\frac{64}{39} = \frac{sin \theta}{cos \theta} \\
   \Rightarrow\ &\frac{64}{39} = tan \theta \\
   \Rightarrow\ &\theta = arctan (\frac{64}{39}) \approx 58.64^{\circ}
\end{align}

Hence, the angle at which the steepness would be optimized would be $58.64^{\circ}$. Note also that the direction that the gradient is pointing is steepest.

** Optimizing for flatness
Similar to before, we want to figure an angle $\theta$ such that the value of the slope at that point would be $0$, that is:

\begin{equation}
    39cos{\theta} + 64sin{\theta} = 0
\end{equation}

Solving for the value of $\theta$ in this expression:

\begin{align}
    & 39cos{\theta} + 64sin{\theta} = 0 \\
\Rightarrow\ & 64sin{\theta} = -39cos{\theta} \\
\Rightarrow\ & tan{\theta} = \frac{-39}{64} \\
\Rightarrow\ & \theta = arctan(\frac{-39}{64}) \approx -31.36^{\circ} 
\end{align}

Hence, the angle at which the steepness would be minimized would be $-31.36^{\circ}$.

Note also that this is the vector for with the dot with the steepest vector is zero. That's "orthogonal", and hence the flattest angle.
