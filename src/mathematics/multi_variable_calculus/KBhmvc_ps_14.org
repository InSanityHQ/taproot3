Find all of the first, second, and third partial derivatives of this function (including the mixed ones):

\begin{equation}
    f(x,y) = 4x^2y^5+3x^3y^2
\end{equation}

\begin{align}
    f_{x} =& 8xy^5 + 9x^2y^2 \\

* Jacobian Derivative Matrix 

** $f(x,y) = \frac{xy}{x^2+y^2}$
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = \frac{(x^2+y^2) y - xy(2x)}{(x^2+y^2)^2}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = \frac{(x^2+y^2)x - xy(2y)}{(x^2+y^2)^2}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    f'(x,y) = \begin{bmatrix}
\frac{(x^2+y^2) y - xy(2x)}{(x^2+y^2)^2} \\
\frac{(x^2+y^2)x - xy(2y)}{(x^2+y^2)^2}
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

** $f(x,y,z) = [xy+2yz,2x^2y^2]$
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial f^0}{\partial x} = y
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial f^1}{\partial x} = 4xy^2
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial f^0}{\partial y} = x+2z
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial f^1}{\partial y} = 4yx^2
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    f'(x,y,z) = \begin{bmatrix}
y & x+2z \\
4xy^2 & 4yx^2 
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

* Total First Derivatives
#+begin_quote
Suppose you have a function $\mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^1$, how many total first partial derivatives does it have? What about second partial derivatives? ... What about k'th partial derivatives.
#+end_quote

For a function $\mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^1$, it has $2$ first partial derivatives, $3$ second partial derivatives, $4$ third partial derivatives, and $k+1$ k-th partial derivatives.

* Multi-Variable Slopes
\begin{equation}
    f(x,y) = 7x+2x^2y^3+10y^2
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    f_x = 7+4xy^3
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    f_y = 6x^2y^2 + 20y
\end{equation}


** Steepness of function at $[-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}, \frac{1}{2}]$
The gradient at the origin, as a vector, is $[7, 0]$

*** Steepness of the Function at Point
Projecting that unto the direction of $[-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}, \frac{1}{2}]$ would result in:

\begin{equation}
\begin{bmatrix}
7 \\ 0
\end{bmatrix} \cdot
\begin{bmatrix}
-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\\ \frac{1}{2}
\end{bmatrix} = 
-\frac{7\sqrt{3}}{2}
\end{equation}

Hence, $\frac{-7\sqrt{3}}{2}$ is the "slope" of the function at $(0,0)$ facing $[-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}, \frac{1}{2}]$. The angle of which the slope represents, therefore, would be $arctan(\frac{-7\sqrt{3}}{2}) \approx -80^{\circ}$. 

** Optimizing for steepness
We want to figure an angle $\theta$ such that the gradient would be most steep, that is, a $\theta$ such that...

\begin{equation}
    7\cos{\theta}
\end{equation}

is maximized. As the $max(cos(\theta)) = 1$ for any $\theta$, and such a value exists at $\theta = 0$, we deduce that at $\theta = 0$ the steepness would be maximized.

To maximize the steepness of the function in the other direction, we simply reverse the value of $\theta$ by $\pi = 180^{\circ}$, making the steepest direction to turn in $\theta = \pi$.

** Optimizing for flatness
Similar to before, we want to figure an angle $\theta$ such that the value of the slope at that point would be $0$, that is:

\begin{equation}
    7cos\theta = 0
\end{equation}

We know that $cos(\frac{\pi}{2}) = 0$, meaning that we could deduct the angle at which the function would have no steepness would therefore be $\theta = \frac{\pi}{2} = 90^{\circ}$.
