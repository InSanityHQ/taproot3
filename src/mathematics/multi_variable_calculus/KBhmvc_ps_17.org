** Facing an Arbitrary Direction
#+begin_quote
Suppose you have a function $f(x,y); f:\mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^1$. Imagine you are standing at this function, at the point $(x,y)$, facing $\theta$. What is the slope? For what value is the slope greatest? Upwards? Downwards? Flat?
#+end_quote

*** Slope at point $\theta$
The slope at angle $\theta$ is as follows:

\begin{equation}
f_x (x,y) \cos(\theta) + f_y (x,y) \sin(\theta)
\end{equation}

This simply acts to project the components of the gradient of $f$ upon its axis $x$ and $y$ -- $\cos(\theta)$ and $\sin(\theta)$ respectively -- and sum them into one scalar value.

*** Greatest slope Upwards
The process to find the angle $\theta$ at which to maximize the slope requires optimizing the above-derived expression. As we know that there exists a $\theta$ such that the slope would be maximized, we could perform this by solving for $\theta$ on the following expression:

\begin{equation}
\frac{d}{d\theta}( f_x (x,y) \cos(\theta) + f_y (x,y) \sin(\theta)) = 0
\end{equation}

Solution of this expression would therefore be the angle at which the slope is maximized. Hence, we solve for $\theta$ in the above expression.

\begin{align}
&\frac{d}{d\theta}( f_x (x,y) \cos(\theta) + f_y (x,y) \sin(\theta)) = 0 \\
\Rightarrow &-f_x(x,y) \sin(\theta) + f_y (x,y) \cos(\theta) = 0 \\
\Rightarrow & f_y (x,y) \cos(\theta) = f_x(x,y) \sin(\theta)  \\
\Rightarrow & \frac{f_y (x,y)}{f_x(x,y)} = \frac{\sin(\theta)}{\tan(\theta)} \\
\Rightarrow & \frac{f_y (x,y)}{f_x(x,y)} = \tan(\theta) \\
\Rightarrow & \theta = \arctan(\frac{f_y (x,y)}{f_x(x,y)})
\end{align}

The unit direction vector representing this slope, therefore, would be:

\begin{equation}
   \begin{bmatrix} 
   \frac{f_x(x,y)}{\sqrt{{f_x}^2(x,y)+{f_y}^2(x,y)}} \\
   \frac{f_y(x,y)}{\sqrt{{f_x}^2(x,y)+{f_y}^2(x,y)}} \\
   \end{bmatrix} 
\end{equation}

*** Greatest slope Downwards

Given the max $\theta$ as derived above:

\begin{equation}
\pi  - \theta
\end{equation}

The vector orthogonal to the vector direction representing the maximum slope will represent the smallest slope.

The vector representing this expression, therefore, would be

\begin{equation}
\begin{bmatrix}
    \cos(\pi - \theta) \\
    \sin(\pi - \theta) \\
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

*** Angle of Flat Slope

To figure the angle at which a flat slope exists, we simply solve for an expression for $\theta$ while setting the above-derived expression for slope-at-angle at $0$ as that would represent a flat slope.

\begin{align}
& f_x (x,y) \cos(\theta) + f_y (x,y) \sin(\theta) = 0 \\
& \Rightarrow f_y (x,y) \sin(\theta) = -f_x (x,y) \cos(\theta) \\
& \Rightarrow \frac{-f_x (x,y)}{f_y (x,y)} = \frac{\sin(\theta)}{\cos(\theta)} \\
& \Rightarrow \frac{-f_x (x,y)}{f_y (x,y)} = \tan(\theta) \\
& \Rightarrow \theta = \arctan{\frac{-f_x (x,y)}{f_y (x,y)}}
\end{align}

* Sand Dunes

#+begin_quote
You are trudging across a field of sand dunes, which the prevailing winds have blown into perfect, parallel, straight lines (or straight ridges, rather). You know that if you walk directly north-northeast, you'll make it to the oasis city of Iskendrebad. The landscape follows the function $f(x,y) = \sin(x)$; you're at the point with $x$ coordinate $23\pi/3$ and $y$ coordinate $37$.

** What is your elevation
At that point, you are at an elevation of $\sin(\frac{23 \pi}{3}) = \frac{-\sqrt{3}}{2}$

** What does your hike look like?
"North-northeast" could translate an angle of roughly $68^{\circ} \approx 0.0174533\ rad$. Slicing though the manifold with a line $y=2.475x$, which represents the same angle...

We first parameterize the slice equation as follows:

\begin{align*}
&y = t \\
&x = \frac{1}{2.475} t
\end{align*}

The function at $f(\frac{t}{2.475},t)$, therefore, is:

\begin{equation}
   f(\frac{t}{2.475},t) = \sin(\frac{t}{2.475}) 
\end{equation}

Hence, the hike will also behave as $f(t) = \sin(\frac{t}{2.475})$.

This could also be understood as the line at which $y=2.475x$ intersects with $z = \sin(x)$. We could solve for the expression w.r.t. setting $x$ values equal.

\begin{align}
   y=2.475x \\
\Rightarrow x = \frac{y}{2.475} \\
\Rightarrow z = \sin(\frac{y}{2.475})
\end{align}

** What's the function for the slope along your hike?
The function for the slope along the hike is the single-variable derivative of the parametrized function above; that is:

\begin{equation}
    f'(t) = \frac{d}{dt} \sin(\frac{t}{2.475}) = \frac{1}{2.475} \cos(\frac{t}{2.475})
\end{equation}

** How steep is the sand dune at the point you're standing (in the direction you're hiking)?
As per above, the direction in which we are standing is at $68^{\circ}$. This would represent a direction vector of:

\begin{equation}
   \begin{bmatrix}
0.374606 \\ 
0.927183 
   \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

The gradient of the function at point at $(\frac{23\pi}{3}, 37)$:

\begin{equation}
\begin{bmatrix}
-\frac{1}{2} \\
0
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

Therefore, the slope at that point is:

\begin{equation}
   \begin{bmatrix}
0.374606 \\ 
0.927183 
   \end{bmatrix} \cdot \begin{bmatrix}
-\frac{1}{2} \\
0
\end{bmatrix} = -0.1873032967
\end{equation}

This would amount to a slope of $\arctan(-0.1873032967) \approx -10.609^{\circ}$
