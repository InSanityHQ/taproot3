* Plane Tangent to a Surface
#+begin_quote
Here's a surface:

\begin{equation}
   x^2 - 3y^2 + z^2 = 7 
\end{equation}

** Find the Equation of the Plane Tangent to it at $(1,1,3)$

We will first establish an equation for the statement w.r.t. $z$:

\begin{align}
&x^2 - 3y^2 +z^2 = 7 \\
\Rightarrow &z^2 = 7-x^2 + 3y^2 \\
\Rightarrow &z = \sqrt{7-x^2 + 3y^2}
\end{align}

Then, we find the components of the slope in each of the dimensions.

\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \sqrt{7-x^2 + 3y^2} \\
\Rightarrow \frac{-2x}{2\sqrt{7-x^2 + 3y^2}} \\
\Rightarrow \frac{-x}{\sqrt{7-x^2 + 3y^2}}
\end{align}

\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial}{\partial y} \sqrt{7-x^2 + 3y^2} \\
\Rightarrow \frac{6y}{2\sqrt{7-x^2 + 3y^2}} \\
\Rightarrow \frac{3y}{\sqrt{7-x^2 + 3y^2}}
\end{align}

Therefore, at point $(1,1,3)$, the gradient is as follows

\begin{equation}
\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{-1}{3} \\
1
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

The basic equation for the plane, then, would be:

\begin{equation}
   z = \frac{-1}{3}x+1y + b 
\end{equation}

As the plane is tangent to $(1,1,3)$, we will supply these values and calculate the necessary constant.

\begin{align}
    &3 = -\frac{1}{3}+1 + b \\
\Rightarrow &3 = \frac{2}{3} + b \\
\Rightarrow &b = \frac{7}{3}
\end{align}

** Graph the surface and its tangent plane!

We first will figure the first and seconds derivatives of this function to check and verify its critical points.

\begin{equation}
   f'(x) = 4x^3 - 18x 
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
   f''(x) = 12x^2 - 18 
\end{equation}

To figure the critical points (maxima, minima, inflection), we first solve for the points in which $f'(x)$ is $0$. 

\begin{align}
    &0 = 4x^3 - 18x \\
    \Rightarrow & 0 = x(4x^2 - 18) \\
    \Rightarrow & x = \{0, \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}, \frac{-3\sqrt{2}}{2}\}
\end{align}

We then figure the second derivatives of the function at these two points.

\begin{equation}
   f''(\{0, \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}, \frac{-3\sqrt{2}}{2}\}) = \{-18, 36, 36 \}
\end{equation}

At the first critical point, the second derivative is negative. By the second-derivative test, therefore, this point serves as a local maxima is the function, after that point, would begin to exhibit a negative slope and then proceed to decrease.

At the second and third critical points, the second derivative is positive. By the second-derivative test, therefore, this point serves as local minima as the function, after that point, would begin to exhibit a positive slope and then proceed to increase.

The coordinates of the critical points are, therefore, as follows:

| Type   | x           |      y |
|--------+-------------+--------|
| maxima | 0           |      0 |
| minima | 3sqrt(2)/2  | -20.25 |
| minima | -3sqrt(2)/2 | -20.25 |

** $f(x) = x^5 - x^4 - 6x^3$

We first will figure the first and seconds derivatives of this function to check and verify its critical points.

\begin{equation}
   f'(x) = 5x^4 - 4x^3 - 18x^2 
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
   f''(x) = 20x^3 - 12x^2 - 36x
\end{equation}

To figure the critical points (maxima, minima, inflection), we first solve for the points in which $f'(x)$ is $0$. 

\begin{align}
    &0 = 5x^4 - 4x^3 - 18x^2 \\
    \Rightarrow &0 = x^2 (5x^2 - 4x^1 - 18) \\
    \Rightarrow &x = \{0, \frac{4 + \sqrt{376}}{10}, \frac{4 - \sqrt{376}}{10}\} 
\end{align}

We then figure the second derivatives of the function at these two points.

\begin{equation}
   f''(\{0, \frac{4 + \sqrt{376}}{10}, \frac{4 - \sqrt{376}}{10}\}) \approx \{0, 106.09, -45.93\}
\end{equation}

At the first critical point, the second derivative is zero. By the second-derivative test, this would mean that that point is an inflection point --- the function changes increasing/decreasing status at that point..

At the second critical point, the second derivative is positive. By the second-derivative test, therefore, this point serves as local minima as the function, after that point, would begin to exhibit a positive slope and then proceed to increase.

At the third critical point, the second derivative is negative. By the second-derivative test, therefore, this point serves as a local maxima is the function, after that point, would begin to exhibit a negative slope and then proceed to decrease.

The coordinates of the critical points are, therefore, as follows:

| Type       | x                |     y |
|------------+------------------+-------|
| inflection | 0                |     0 |
| minima     | (4+sqrt(346))/10 | -36.7 |
| maxima     | (4-sqrt(346))/10 |  7.63 |
