* Building the Roof
We first begin to construct the general shape of the house' slope, without the leaning bounds. For this, we leverage a hyperbolic parabaloid with an logarithmic component along the $y$ direction to simulate tapering: $f(x,y) = \frac{1}{15}x^2 + ln(y)$. Evidently, we crop out dimensions where $y<1$ to reduce the large, $-\infty$ trend.

#+begin_src sage
f(x,y) = (1/15)*x^2 + ln(y)
plot3d(f, (x,-5,5), (y,1,10))
#+end_src

Based on the image of the construction, we could see that the $+x$ components is higher than the $-x$ component, so we shift the x-direction slightly to maintain this. 

#+begin_src sage
f(x,y) = (1/15)*x^2 + ln(y)
plot3d(f, (x,-4,6), (y,1,10))
#+end_src

Finally, we realize that there are a linear ledge that cuts through this building, which we will simulate by plotting two bound lines:

#+begin_src sage
g = Graphics()
f(x,y) = (1/15)*x^2 + ln(y)
g += plot3d(f, (x,-4,6), (y,1,10))
g += plot((1/2)*y+1, (y,0,5), thickness=2, color="green")
g += plot(-(1/2)*x+1, (x,-4,0), thickness=2, color="blue")
g

Indeed, that the blue and green lines slice through the function to create its triangular bounds.

* Slope
#+begin_quote
What is the slope of the roof?
#+end_quote

The slope of the roof is represented as the gradient of the roof function at any point. The function of the roof is:

\begin{equation}
f(x,y) = \frac{1}{15}x^2 + ln(y)
\end{equation}

Therefore, we take the gradient of the function to figure the slope.

\begin{equation}
    \nabla f = \begin{bmatrix}
\frac{2}{15}x \\
\frac{1}{y}
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

Therefore, at any point $(x,y)$, the slope is represented as above. Furthermore, it has an angle of:

\begin{equation}
   arctan(\frac{15}{2xy})
\end{equation}

* Slope at Center
#+begin_quote
Suppose you are standing at the exact center of this roof --- or, to be a bit more precise, on a spot that's directly over the center of the footprint of the building. What is the slope of the roof at that point?
#+end_quote

If we are dealing with the center of the roof, footprint wise, we are actually bound by three functions.

\begin{equation}
    \begin{cases}
y=2x-2 \\
y=\frac{-1}{2}x+1 \\
y=10 \\
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}

We calculate the three point of intersections between these three lines.

\begin{equation}
    \begin{cases}
(6, 10) \\
(\frac{6}{5}, \frac{2}{5}) \\
(-18, 10)
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}

Therefore, we need to find the center of the object as bounded by these two points.

The x-bounds are $[-18, 6]$, and the y-bounds are $[\frac{2}{5}, 10]$. The centre therefore, are the average of these points: namely, $(\frac{-44}{5}, 8)$.

We then apply these coordinates to the gradient function to figure the slope at the center. 

\begin{equation}
    \nabla f(\frac{-44}{5}, 8) = \begin{bmatrix}
\frac{-88}{75} \\
\frac{1}{8}
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

* Slope at Middle
#+begin_quote
Suppose you are standing in the same spot, facing directly towards the middle of one of the shorter-length sides. What is the slope at that point, in that direction?
#+end_quote

One of the sides is defined by the following expression:

\begin{equation}
    y = 2x-2
\end{equation}

It is, furthermore, bounded by $0 \leq x \leq 6$, as the maximum $y$ value of the function is $y=10$; therefore, solving the expression for $x$ results in the new $y$ value of $10$.

Halfway through the bounds, therefore, is $x=3$. Therefore, it is towards the point $(3, 4)$; we are currently located at $(\frac{-44}{5}, 8)$, therefore the vector difference between the two points:

\begin{equation}
\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{59}{5}\\
   -4 
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

We will now normalize this vector:

\begin{equation}
   \begin{bmatrix} 
\frac{59}{3881\sqrt{ 3881 }}\\
\frac{-20}{3881\sqrt{ 3881 }}
   \end{bmatrix} 
\end{equation}

Finally, we will then project our gradient as calculated above upon this normalized vector:

\begin{equation}
    \begin{bmatrix} 
\frac{59}{3881\sqrt{ 3881 }}\\
\frac{-20}{3881\sqrt{ 3881 }}
   \end{bmatrix} \cdot \begin{bmatrix} 
\frac{-88}{75} \\
\frac{1}{8}
\end{bmatrix} = \frac{10009}{582150 \sqrt{3881}}
\end{equation}

We then scale the normalized direction vector with this magnitude:

\begin{equation}
\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{590531}{2259324150} \\ \frac{-20018}{225932415}
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

This was surprisingly lengthy value-wise, though it is actually quite a small value. This makes sense, as the "horizontal" direction slope is very flat.

* Slope at a corner 
#+begin_quote
Suppose you are standing in the same spot, facing towards one of the corner of the roof. What is the slope at that point, in that direction?
#+end_quote

We note that the intersections of the bound lines forms the "front" corner of the roof at $(\frac{6}{5}, \frac{2}{5})$. We further note that we are currently located at $(\frac{-44}{5}, 8)$. Therefore, we find the vector difference between these two points:

\begin{equation}
   \begin{bmatrix} 
10 \\
\frac{-38}{5}
   \end{bmatrix} 
\end{equation}

We now normalize this vector:

\begin{equation}
    \begin{bmatrix}
\frac{25}{986 \sqrt{986}} \\
\frac{-19}{986 \sqrt{986}} \\
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

We finally project this vector upon our gradient:

\begin{equation}
    \begin{bmatrix}
\frac{25}{986 \sqrt{986}} \\
\frac{-19}{986 \sqrt{986}} \\
    \end{bmatrix} \cdot \begin{bmatrix} 
\frac{-88}{75} \\
\frac{1}{8}
\end{bmatrix} = \frac{-761}{23664\sqrt{ 986 }}
\end{equation}

and finally, scale the normalized direction vector by this magnitude:

\begin{equation}
\begin{bmatrix}
    \frac{-19025}{23664} \\
    \frac{14459}{23664} \\
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

* Orthogonal Vector
#+begin_quote
Suppose you are standing in the same spot, and you want to face in the direction such that the roof is flat. What direction do you face in?
#+end_quote

To make the direction of the roof flat, we go in the negative-reciprocal direction of the gradient vector; that:

\begin{equation}
    \begin{bmatrix}
\frac{1}{8} \\
\frac{88}{75} \\
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

We could verify that this vector is indeed flat at that point by applying the dot product to the original gradient vector:

\begin{equation}
    \begin{bmatrix}
\frac{1}{8} \\
\frac{88}{75} \\
\end{bmatrix} \cdot \begin{bmatrix}
\frac{-88}{75} \\
\frac{1}{8}
\end{bmatrix} = 0
\end{equation}

This direction, therefore, would represent a direction for a flat root.
