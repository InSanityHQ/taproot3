* Problem 1
** a)
Inorder for the boat to be going in the right direction we know that $\vec C+\vec S=\alpha\vec D$, where $\vec C$ is the current of the river, $\vec S$ is the speed of the boat, $\alpha$ is some scalar and $\vec D$ is the vector that goes from the boatman's starting point to their desired endpoint.

We can set the boatman's start point as $(0,0)$, and thus $\vec D=\langle3,2\rangle$. We also know that $\vec C= \langle0,-3.5\rangle$. Lastly, $\vec S=\langle13\sin(\theta),13\cos(\theta)\rangle$, where $\theta$ is the angle between the side of the river and $\vec S$.

We can then plug in these values into the equation written above:

$\vec C + \vec S = \alpha\vec D\newline\Rightarrow \langle 0,-3.5\rangle+\langle13\sin(\theta),13\cos(\theta)\rangle=\alpha\langle3,2\rangle\newline\Rightarrow\langle13\sin(\theta),-3.5+13\cos(\theta)\rangle=\langle\alpha3,\alpha2\rangle\newline\Rightarrow13\sin(\theta)=\alpha3,-3.5+13\cos(\theta)=\alpha2\newline\Rightarrow6\alpha=26\sin(\theta),6\alpha=-10.5+39\cos(\theta)\newline\Rightarrow26\sin(\theta)=-10.5+39\cos(\theta)$

plug it into wolfram alpha:

$\theta \approx0.75686$ radians or $\approx 43.36^{\circ}$
** b)
The net velocity of the boat is $\vec S+\vec C=\langle13\sin(\theta),13\cos(\theta)-3.5\rangle$, where $\theta$ is the answer to part a. To get the speed of the boat we find the magnitude of this vector:

$|\vec S+\vec C|=\sqrt{(13\sin(\theta))^2+(13\cos(\theta)-3.5)}\approx10.7282$ km/h

Now we need to find the distance traveled by the boat, which should be the magnitude of $\vec D$:

$|\vec D|=\sqrt{2^2+3^2}=\sqrt{4+9}=\sqrt{13}\approx 3.60555$ km

To get the time it took to take the trip we divide the distace by the speed:

${3.60555\over10.7282}=0.336$ hours, which is $20.2$ minutes
