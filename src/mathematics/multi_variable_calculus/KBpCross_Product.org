* Dot product:
- Name: dot product
- Result: Scalar
- Interpretation (what it measures): parallelity
  - the more parallel the larger the dot product
- Magnitude (with sign): $|\vec a||\vec b|cos(\theta)$
- Geometric magnitude: $|\vec a||\vec b_{\parallel \vec a}|$
- Direction: no direction
- Algebraic form: $a_xb_x+a_yb_y+a_zb_z$
- Algebraic properties:
  - commutative
  - associative
  - distributive across addition

* Cross product:
- Name: Cross product
- Result: Vector
- Interpretation (what it measures): Orthgonality
  - the more orthogonal the longer the cross product
- Magnitude (with sign): $|\vec a||\vec b|\sin(\theta)$
- Geometric Magnitude: $|\vec a||\vec b_{\perp \vec a}|$
- Direction: perpendicular to the two vectors
  - by the right hand rule by rotating the first vector into the second vector
