* Dot product:
- Name: dot product
- Result: Scalar
- Interpretation (what it measures): parallelity
  - the more parallel the larger the dot product
- Magnitude (with sign): $|\vec a||\vec b|cos(\theta)$
- Geometric magnitude: $|\vec a||\vec b_{\parallel \vec a}|$
- Direction: no direction
- Algebraic form: $a_xb_x+a_yb_y+a_zb_z$
- Algebraic properties:
  - commutative
  - associative
  - distributive across addition

* Cross product:
- Name: Cross product
- Result: Vector
- Interpretation (what it measures): Orthgonality
  - the more orthogonal the longer the cross product
- Magnitude (with sign): $|\vec a||\vec b|\sin(\theta)$
- Geometric Magnitude: $|\vec a||\vec b_{\perp \vec a}|$
- Direction: perpendicular to the two vectors
  - by the right hand rule by rotating the first vector into the second vector
- Albraic form: $\langle a_yb_z-a_zb_y,a_xb_z-a_zb_x,a_xb_y-a_yb_x\rangle$  
- Algebraic properties:
  - Anticommutative
  - $\vec A\times\vec B=-\vec B\times\vec A$
  - $(\vec A\times\vec B)\perp\vec A$
  - $(\vec A\times\vec B)\perp\vec B$
  - Antiassociative

* Application of cross product:
- In physics there is something called torque, notated $\tau$
  - Torqe is the net force of things that rotate, so:
    - $F_{net}=ma$
    - $\tau_{net}=I\omega$
- Somethings to note about $\tau$:
  - It increases with a longer lever
  - It increases with a greater force
    - that is perpendicular to the lever
- Given these requirements we can make a formula:
  - $|\tau|=|\vec r||\vec F_{\perp\vec r}|$, where $\vec F$ is the force applied to the door, and $\vec r$ is the radius of the lever.
  - this, the right side of the equation, can be described using the dot product: $|\tau|=\vec r\times\vec F$

* Derivation of cross product algebraic form:
To start, we can define:

$$\vec A =(A_x,A_y,A_z) = A_x\hat i+A_y\hat j+A_z\hat k$$

$$\vec B=(B_x,B_y,B_z)=B_x\hat i+B_y\hat j+B_z\hat k$$

Next we have to assume that the dot product is distributive across addition:

$\begin{center*}
\vec A\times\vec B=(A_x\hat i+A_y\hat j+A_Z\hat k)\times(B_x\hat i+B_y\hat j+B_z\hat k)\\
= A_xB_x\hat i\times\hat i+A_xB_y\hat i\times\hat j+A_xB_z\hat i\times\hat k\\
+A_yB_x\hat j\times\hat i + A_yB_y\hat j\times\hat j +A_yB_z\hat j\times\hat k\\
+A_zB_x\hat k\times\hat i +A_zB_y\hat k\times\hat j + A_zB_z\hat k\times\hat k
\end{center*}$

From the definition of a cross product, we know that the cross product between any two vectors that are parallel is zero, thus:

$\begin{center*}
=A_xB_y\hat i\times\hat j+A_xB_z\hat i\times\hat k\\
+A_yB_x\hat j\times \hat i+A_yB_z\hat j\times \hat k\\
+A_zB_x\hat k\times \hat i+A_zB_y\hat k\times \hat j
\end{center*}$

$\hat i\times\hat j$ would yield a vector length one in the direction of a vector that is perpendicular to both $\hat i$ and $\hat j$, which would be $\hat k$. Conversly, $\hat i\times\hat j=-\hat k$. Therefore:

$\begin{center*}
=A_xB_y\hat k-A_xB_z\hat j\\
-A_yB_x\hat k + A_yB_z\hat i\\
+A_zB_x\hat j-A_zB_y\hat i\\
=A_xB_y\hat k-A_yB_x\hat k\\
+A_yB_z\hat i-A_zB_y\hat i\\
-A_xB_z\hat j+A_zB_x\hat j\\
=(A_xB_y-A_yB_x)\hat k+(A_yB_z-A_zB_y)\hat i+(A_zB_x-A_xB_z)\hat j\\
=(A_yB_z-A_zB_y,A_zB_x-A_xB_z,A_xB_y-A_yB_x)
\end{center*}$

Now we need to show that the cross product is distributive across addition:

We can start with:

$$\vec A\times(\vec B+\vec C)=\vec A\times \vec B+\vec A\times\vec C$$

due to the definition of the cross product, and the fact that all of the terms are the cross prouduct with A and some other vector, we know that all of the terms are coplaner vectors, in which the plane is perpendicular to $\vec A$. We also know that the term $\vec A\times \vec B$ is perpendicular to $\vec B$ and that $\vec A\times \vec C$ is perpendicular to $\vec C$.

Next we can show that the projection of a vector $\vec B$ onto the plane perpendicular to $\vec A$, is perpendicular to $\vec A \times\vec B$. To do this we can take the linear algebra definition of a plane: 

* Determinate form of cross product:
$$\begin{vmatrix}
\hat i & \hat j & \hat k\\
A_x & A_y & A_z\\
B_x & B_y & B_z
\end{vmatrix}$$

It is not actually a determinate because it has vectors, it is just a good way to remember what the cross product is.
