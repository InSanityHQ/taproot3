#+TITLE: Area of a Polar Curve
* the equation 
  The goal is to add a bunch of slices, $d \theta$. For instance, you can approximate each slice as a sector of a circle:
  
  \[\begin{aligned}
  dA &= \underbrace{\left( \pi r^2 \right)}_{\text{Area of the full circle}} \underbrace{\frac{d\theta}{2\pi}}_{\text{Fraction of the circle}}\\
  dA &= \color{blue}\left( \pi r^2 \right)\color{green}\frac{d\theta}{2\pi}\\
  \text{where} &\quad\color{blue}\text{The area of the full circle}\\
  &\quad\color{green}\text{The portion of the circle covered by} d\theta 
  \end{aligned}\]
  And so, the full equation would be
  
  \[\begin{aligned}
  \boxed{
  A = \int_{0}^{2\pi } \frac{1}{2}r^2 d\theta 
  }
  \end{aligned}\]
  Make sure you pick the bounds such that it only goes once around! If it's a cardiod with overlappy bits then you gotta make sure you know what area you're talking about.

** alternative formulation

   You could also formulate the circle slice as an icosolese triangle, where the base is $r d\theta$ and the height is $r$. Then, the area of the triangle is
   
   \[\begin{aligned}
   dA &= \frac{1}{2}bh &= \frac{1}{2}r^2d\theta 
   \end{aligned}\]

   Which results in the same equation as above.
