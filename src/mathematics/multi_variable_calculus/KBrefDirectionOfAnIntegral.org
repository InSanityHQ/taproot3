#+TITLE: Direction of the integral: dx defines the positive direction
* $dx$ is defined as a small change *in the positive direction*
  so $dx$ defines the positive direction. 
** In polar curves, $d\theta$ defines the positive direction. positive theta is counter-clockwise so your definite integral bounds should always go from negative to positive.
