#+TITLE: Right Handed Coordinate System
* right handed coordinate system                                        :def:
  
  \[\begin{aligned}
  \hat{i} \times \hat{j} = \hat{k}
  \end{aligned}\]

  It follows that
  
  \[\begin{aligned}
  \hat{i} \times \hat{k} &= -\hat{j} \\
  \hat{j} \times \hat{i} &= -\hat{k} \\
  \hat{j} \times \hat{k} &= \hat{i} \\
  \hat{k} \times \hat{j} &= - \hat{i} 
  \end{aligned}\]
** a mnemonic
   
   \[\begin{aligned}
   \hat{i} \hat{j} \hat{k} \hat{i} \hat{j} \hat{k} \dots  
   \end{aligned}\]

   Read it left to right, and the next one will be the cross product. If it's in the wrong answer, then read it backwards and reverse the sign.
