#+TITLE: TIPS for converting from polar to cartesian

- Instead of geting arctangents everywhere, try to insert $r$s such that you get $r \cos  \theta$s and $r \sin  \theta$s because they are easy to replace with $x$ and $y$.

- if you can manipulate things such that constants are subtracted by numebers going to infinity, then you can ignore them.
