*In considering recent assignments, what are you proud of?*

For the semester, I am actually very proud of my work re-thinking evidence I found for the Bluest Eyes essay as a part of the re-assessment. I think my original essay was not at a great place when I initially submitted it, as I---unfortunately as a point I need to improve on---has made the essay again into a logical series of deductions that slowly veered away from the content of the text.

In my re-assessment, I was able to rethink the body of evidence shown in the text to focus on being much more grounded in the work in honoring its content. Furthermore, I took care in rethinking my sentence structure to be more "conversational": keeping the same level of formality but reducing the amount of long trains of thought and logic as a way to clarify my writing.

*What are your areas of strength in terms of literary analysis as we close the year?*

I think I was able to successfully closely read the texts themselves fairly well. Despite a few analytical reaches, my initial layer of close reading---for myself---often brought nuance and complexity in the text which I did not see before.

Furthermore, I consider my class participation and ability to engage others in the course a very helpful asset. One of the things that I tried to do frequently this semester is to synthesize many others' points and proposing new ideas in the combination of information from others. In this way, I can participate in the conversation at the class without being super domineering.

*What are your continued goals as a writer/reader/speaker for next year? Think of this also as what you still learning or refining, or what's in progress for you.*

Overall, I hope to be more specific and grounded in my analysis of texts. I hope to engage in the text by evaluating more closely authorial intent, and in my work trying to focus around that fact more closely as I am performing analysis. Furthermore, I want to work on expressing more complex thoughts in a more simplified way, to talk more "conversationally" while keeping a tone of professionalism in my work.
