* Things to check out
- QIC Textbook: qubit.guide
- Now he does category theory

* Notes
"French Mathematics"

* Quantum NLP
- Bob Coecke's talk on quantum NLP: https://topos.site/topos-colloquium/
- Symmetric monodal category
- Grammar equations to encoding information: https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.07485

And now, we ignore quantum

- DisCoCat: word vector distance 
- ...Graphical Linear Algebra https://graphicallinearalgebra.net/; translating matrices into category theory graphs https://graphicallinearalgebra.net/2015/06/09/matrices-diagrammatically/
- If you do it in higher dimensions, you get more
- Diagramatic category theory. "string diagrams"
- Cohereance laws

* Random Questions
- Use category theory to design open software??????
- Compiling human language <> mathematics [[https://stanford.edu/~cpiech/bio/papers/codeInternational.pdf][Piech's Lab]]
- Bob Coecke: Quantinuum --- quantum and natural language processing.
