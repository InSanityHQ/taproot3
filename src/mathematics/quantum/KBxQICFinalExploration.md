# Strong Free Will
- free will as a commodity
	- argues that if we have free will then so do particles?
- proof never uses the concept of probability?
- defines free to be not a function of what has happened earlier w.r.t. any frame

## ted talk
bells inequalities prove that we arn't just suffering from a lack of knowledge

it's not the sock, because even *it* (the qbit) doesn't know. bells theorem means we know that is isn't *in* a state until we measure it.

## questions
what even is free will? what is will?

can we equate free will with randomness (ie. lack of determinism)?
