# Fantastic qubits and where to find them!

elevator pitch: can realize every aspect of a quantum computer using atoms?

just having qubits is not enough, also needs to meet other critera

q: what is a qubit? 
a: any quantum mechanical system that has two wavefolds that you can entangle?

## finding a qubit
- different orbits of an electron in an atom
	- can use the different orbits of electrons in a atom to mimic the quantum properties of a qubit
	
- only the first ring is stable
	- light is emitted out of the atom when they jump down orbits, which we can detect!
	- but how do we move them between orbits?
		- hit them with the opposite light -- just like phase transitions 
- lower energy state is better for base state, so we choose the first orbit
- in the real world you can have more than one ground state! which is how we can have two stable states at once

## isolating the qubit
- we gotta isolate, and also interact. 
	- put them in a vaccum and them hit them with lasers
		- known as optical tweezers -- think of the intersection of multiple beams
- how does light actully prevent atoms from moving with light?
	- if you use two lasers that arnt exactly resonant, it creates a pocket of lower energy?
	
- can also do something called optical pumping
	- which allows us to use auxillary qubits to get over the fact that all our gates are unitary, hermitatian, and thus invertible
- we can use 1Q gates to move a qubit anywhere else on the blohck sphere
