# sizes of infinity!

what is cardinality? just the number of elements in a set.
$|x|$ essentially corresponds to the question of "how big?"

- it can represent
	- absolute value
	- magnitude
	- determinant

but things break when we get to infinity. 
we think about the "gold standard" of infinity as the set of all natural numbers.
- this set is countably infinite
	- you can count em! you can "make progress"
	- we can denote this as $\aleph_0$
	- ie. $|\mathbb{N}|=\infty = \aleph_0$
	
we also get integers
cool: denote the set of rational nums
$\mathbb{Q}=\{\frac{a}{b}|a,b \in \mathbb{Z}, b \neq 0\}$
