# sizes of infinity!

what is cardinality? just the number of elements in a set.
$|x|$ essentially corresponds to the question of "how big?" [[KBxLInAlgDayTwo#Types of Numbers]]

- it can represent
	- absolute value
	- magnitude
	- determinant

but things break when we get to infinity. 
we think about the "gold standard" of infinity as the set of all natural numbers.
- this set is countably infinite
	- you can count em! you can "make progress"
	- we can denote this as $\aleph_0$
	- ie. $|\mathbb{N}|=\infty = \aleph_0$
	
we also get integers
- cool: denote the set of rational nums
	- $\mathbb{Q}=\{\frac{a}{b}|a,b \in \mathbb{Z}, b \neq 0\}$
	- cayley dickson construction allow us to navigate to higher algebras with double the dimension as the previous 
	- $2 \mathbb{Z}$ as the set of all things in Z that are divisible by two (ie. we are just multiplying it by two)
	- can think of real numbers as "adding all the grout" into rational numbers

how do we **actully** check? 
we see if we can construct a bijection [[KBrefBijectiveFunction.org]] [[KBx3BInclass#^216fc0]]

with this we can finally say that infin and infin+1 are equal
