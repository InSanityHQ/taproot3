* Deriving Rotational KE and Inertia
Given $m_i$, mass, $\vec{r_i}'$, location of the center of mass, $l_i$, $\omega$, the angular velocity, figure a $KE_{tot,rot}$. 

Because of the fact that the value $\omega$ is in units $\frac{d\theta}{dt}$, the rate of radians change, and we know of a radius of the spin $l_i$, we could figure the velocity at which it is moving by simply scaling the change in radians up to a circle of radius $l_i$, that is:

\begin{equation}
    V_i' = l_i \omega 
\end{equation}

(note that, to understand this, radians $\frac{arc length}{radius}$)

And so, substituting into the statement of $\sum^N_{i=1} \frac{1}{2}m_i\vec{v_i}'^2$

\begin{align}
    KE_{rot} =& \sum^N_{i=1} \frac{1}{2}m_i\vec{v_i}'^2 \\
    =& \sum^N_{i=1} \frac{1}{2}m_i(l_i \omega)^2 \\
    =& \sum^N_{i=1} \frac{1}{2}m_i l_i^2 \omega^2 \\
    =& \frac{1}{2}\omega^2 \sum^N_{i=1} (m_i l_i^2)
\end{align}

** Rotational Inertia
The right sum --- the mass times the distance away from maxis of rotation ($\sum^N_{i=1} (m_i l_i^2)$) --- is defined as the rotational (moment) of inertia (spinny mass). That is,

\begin{equation}
    I = \sum^N_{i=1} (m_i l_i^2)
\end{equation}

Replacing that value in the prior statement, the statement of $KE_{rot}$ is defined as:

\begin{equation}
    KE_{rot} = \frac{1}{2}\omega^2I
\end{equation}


** Rotational Inertia for a Ring
For a ring (that's perfectly circular) rotating on an axis perpendicular to the plane of the ring, the $l_i$ --- distance from axis of rotation --- is the same value: namely, the radius $R$ as the radius of a circle is the same for all positions. Meaning,

\begin{equation}
    l_i = R
\end{equation}

regardless of which value $i$.

Hence, the value of $KE_{rot}$ would be evaluated as...

\begin{align}
    KE_{rot} =& \sum^N_{i=1}(m_il^2_i) \\
    =& \sum^N_{i=1}(m_iR^2) \\
    =& R^2 \sum^N_{i=1}m_i \\
\end{align}

Substituting $M$ as the sum of all masses in the ring ($M=\sum^N_{i=1}m_i$), the statement is therefore:

\begin{equation}
    KE_{rot} = MR^2
\end{equation}

** Rotational Inertia of a Solid Sphere
I believe that the rotational inertia of $I_{sphere}$ to be less than $I_{disk}$. This is because, as the dimension of the object increases, it would be easier to change its velocity (a disk is easier to spin than a ring, etc.). Hence, my intuition states that $I_{sphere}$ would be lower than $I_{disk}$.

Mathematically, as $M$ is staying at the same value, in the disk case has more mass closer to the axis of rotation --- meaning that the $m_iR^2$ term would be smaller in more of the point masses than that of an object at a lower dimension. Hence, the sphere would have more points with lower $m_iR^2$ terms than that of disk; hence, $I_{sphere}$ would be less than $I_{disk}$.

* Kinematics Equations 
We begin by defining a coordinate system such that positive values are pointed "downwards".
Given $a=a_0$, initial velocity $v_0$, and position $y_0$, we derive the kinematics equations.

\begin{align}
    a(t) =& a_0 \\
    \int a(t) dt =& \int a_0 dt \\
    v(t) =& a_0t + C 
\end{align}

We are given that $v(0)=v_0$. $v(0) = C = v_0$, hence, $C=v_0$. The velocity statement is therefore,

\begin{equation}
    v(t) = a_0t+v_0
\end{equation}

Continuing with integration:

\begin{align}
    v(t) =& a_0t + v_0 \\
    \int v(t) =& \int a_0t + v_0 dt \\
    y(t) =& \frac{1}{2}a_0t^2+v_0t+C \\
\end{align}

Again, substituting $C = y_0$ by the same logic above --- $y(0) = C = y_0$, we derive the statement for the position equation.

\begin{equation}
    y(t) = \frac{1}{2}a_0t^2 + v_0t + y_0
\end{equation}


** Proving $v^2(t) = v_0^2 + 2a_0(y(t)-y_0)$
We start at the statement for $v(t)$, squaring it, and substituting the necessary statements.

\begin{align}
    v(t) =& a_0t+v_0 \\
    \Rightarrow v^2(t) =& {a_0}^2 t^2 + 2a_0v_0t + v_0^2 \\
    v^2(t) =& {v_0}^2 + 2a_0 (\frac{1}{2} a_0 t^2 + v_0t) \\
    v^2(t) =& {v_0}^2 + 2a_0 (\frac{1}{2} a_0 t^2 + v_0t + y_0 - y_0) \\
    v^2(t) =& {v_0}^2 + 2a_0 (y(t) - y_0) 
\end{align}

It is therefore shown that:

\begin{equation}
    v^2(t) = {v_0}^2 + 2a_0 (y(t) - y_0) 
\end{equation}

** Proving $\Delta y = \frac{v(t_1)+v(t_2)}{2}\Delta t$
Showing $\Delta y = \frac{v(t_1)+v(t_2)}{2}\Delta t$, defining $\Delta y=y(t_2)-y(t_1)$ and $\Delta t = t_2 - t_1$. Substituting the appropriate values for $v(t)$, $\Delta y$, $\Delta t$ and solving...

\begin{align}
    \Delta y &= \frac{v(t_1)+v(t_2)}{2}\Delta t \\
    y(t_2)-y(t_1) &= \frac{v(t_1)+v(t_2)}{2} t_2 - t_1 \\
    y(t_2)-y(t_1) &= \frac{((a_0t_1+v_0)+(a_0t_2+v_0))}{2} t_2 - t_1 \\
    y(t_2)-y(t_1) &= \frac{((a_0t_1t_2+v_0t_2)-(a_0{t_1}^2+v_0t_1)+(a_0{t_2}^2+v_0t_2)-(a_0t_1t_2+v_0t_1))}{2} \\
    y(t_2)-y(t_1) &= \frac{(a_0{t_2}^2+2v_0t_2)-(a_0{t_1}^2+2v_0t_1)}{2} \\
    y(t_2)-y(t_1) &= \frac{(a_0{t_2}^2+2v_0t_2+2y_0)-(a_0{t_1}^2+2v_0t_1+2y_0)}{2} \\
    y(t_2)-y(t_1) &= \frac{1}{2} a_0{t_2}^2+v_0t_2+y_0 - \frac{1}{2} a_0{t_1}^2+v_0t_1+y_0 \\
    y(t_2)-y(t_1) &= y(t_2) - y(t_1) \\
\end{align}
Hence, it is demonstrated that: 

\begin{equation}
    \Delta y = \frac{v(t_1)+v(t_2)}{2}\Delta t
\end{equation}

* Question regarding signage of the equations demonstrated above.
