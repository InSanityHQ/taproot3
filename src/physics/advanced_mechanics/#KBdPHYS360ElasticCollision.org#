For the sake of simplicity I will assume that the stick has 0 width, meaning that it effectively acts as a line.
* Problem 1)
We know that kinetic energy is conserved, so we know that $\Delta KE = 0$.
As such, we know the following:

\begin{aligned}
KE_{ball;i} + KE_{stick;i} &= KE_{ball;f} + KE_{stick;f} \\
\end{aligned}

We know that the stick is initially at rest, and the ball is moving with velocity $v_{0}$. In addition, after the collision the ball has velocity $v_{f}$ a
