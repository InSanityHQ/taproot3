Thank you very much for three great years of physics! I am very thankful for learning all of mechanics in your classes. Through out time together, the class has remained engaging, informative, and taught me many of the skills to become a better researcher and scientist. 

One of the skills I think is particularly useful is the process of proving all the theorems and postulates needed to make any of our claims made in class or on homework. In fact, this type of work has lead me to seek the satisfaction and beauty of setting up a mechanics problem just for the goal of realizing it and seeing how a system evolves. The fact that the evolution of physical systems can be precisely, mathematically modeled remains one of the most important takeaways of the Physics program. 

An additional aspect of this class which I think is very remarkable is how it lead me to build more intuition to material in multi-variable Calculus: that the class is also secretly a MVC class because of the close connectivity the idea of integration as a form of infinite or repeated sums. Mastery with this concept allowed me to derive concepts in MVC more easily, as well as deal with unfamiliar situations (especially, shapes) in mechanics problems as well.

Thank you again for a great semester! I loved the time we spent together, and I hope to see you during future projects around campus.
