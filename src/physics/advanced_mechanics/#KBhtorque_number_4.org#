# Why are we numbering these psets, anyways?

* Notes from Within the Lecture
\begin{equation}
    CM = \frac{\sum m_i \vec{r_i}}{\sum m_i} = \frac{1}{M} \sum m_i \vec{r}_i
\end{equation}

i.e.: the centre of mass is the weighted average of the centers. "First moment."

\begin{equation}
   I = M \frac{\sum m_i {r_i}^2}{M}=\sum m_i {r_i}^2
\end{equation}

i.e.: the rotational inertia is $M$ times the weighted average, squared. "Second moment."

- 1st moment: Mean
- 2nd moment: Standard Deviation
- 3rd moment: Skew
- 4th moment: Kurtosis

If I take an axis, and shift the direction of the axis, we can compute the rotational inertia about the center of mass and then move it

- Disk: $I = \frac{1}{2} MR^2$.
- Ring: $I = MR^2$
- Strip: $I=\frac{1}{12}Mx^2$
- Rectangle: $I= \frac{1}{12}Mx^2$, yes, $x$ along the axis of rotation. And yes, $y$ does not matter.

* Perpendicular Axis Theorem
\begin{equation}
   I_z = I_x + I_y 
\end{equation}

for a laminar object---infinitesimally thin, in the X-Y plane (perpendicular to the $z$ axis).

Why?

\begin{align}
   I_z &= \sum_i m_i {l_i}^2  \\
&= \sum_i m_i{x_i}^2+\sum_i m_i{y_i}^2\\
&= {l_i}^2 = {x_i}^2{y_i}^2
\end{align}

* Proving the Parallel Axis Theorem
We will begin with the definition of rotational inertia about an origin:

\begin{equation}
   I = \sum_i m_i {l_i}^2
\end{equation}

As per defined by the problem $l_i' = x_i' \hat{i} + y_i' \hat{j}$, the displacement vector from $l_i$ to the $CM$.

We also understand that $\vec{R}_{CM} = X_{CM} \hat{i} + Y_{CM} \hat{j}$, the components to the location of the center of mass.

Therefore, the actual position $\vec{l}_i$ of the axis of rotation can be expressed as:

\begin{align}
   l_i &= \vec{R}_{CM} + \vec{l}_i'
\end{align}

Substituting this expression into that for $I$:

\begin{align}
   I &= \sum_i m_i{l_i}^2 \\
&= \sum_i m_i( \vec{R}_{CM} + \vec{l}_i')^2 \\
&= \sum_i m_i( (\vec{R}_{CM})^2 + 2(\vec{R}_{CM})(\vec{l}_i') + (\vec{l}_i')^2) 
\end{align}

We can see that the first and last terms will result in the expression we need, and therefore we are bound to figure why the following expression would result in $0$:

\begin{align}
    &\sum_i 2(\vec{R}_{CM})m_i\vec{l'}_i\\
\Rightarrow\ &2(\vec{R}_{CM}) \sum_i m_i\vec{l'}_i
\end{align}

Recall that $\vec{l'}_i$ is the location of the distance from a given point mass in the body to the center of mass. Of course, this makes $\sum_i m_i\vec{l'}_i$ the expression for the center of mass /in the center of mass reference frame./

We know that the coordinate of the center of mass in the center of mass reference frame is $0$, making this whole expression $0$.

Therefore:

\begin{align}
 I &= \sum_i m_i{l_i}^2 \\   
&= \sum_i m_i( (\vec{R}_{CM})^2 + 2(\vec{R}_{CM})(\vec{l}_i') + (\vec{l}_i')^2) \\
&= (\vec{R}_{CM})^2 \sum_i m_i + \sum_i m_i (\vec{l}_i')^2 \\
&= (\vec{R}_{CM})^2 M + \sum_i m_i (\vec{l}_i')^2 \\
&= D^2 M + I_{CM} \ \blacksquare
\end{align}

* 5-Ring Object
We will leverage the parallel axis theorem to figure the inertia at the center point.

We can see the distance from the center of mass of each side-sphere to the axis of rotation is $2R$. Furthermore, we can see the mass of the ring is $\frac{1}{5}M$.

As been demonstrated before, the rotational inertia of a ring is:

\begin{equation}
    I = MR^2
\end{equation}

For the ring with $\frac{1}{5}$ mass then:

\begin{equation}
    I_{CM} = \frac{1}{5}MR^2
\end{equation}

Applying the parallel axis theorem, then, to each of the four side-objects:

\begin{align}
    I &= I_{CM} + \frac{1}{5} MD^2 \\
&= \frac{1}{5}MR^2 + \frac{4}{5}MR^2 \\
&= MR^2
\end{align}

We repeat this procedure four times, to result in the outer rings' rotational inertia of:

\begin{equation}
    4MR^2
\end{equation}

The last ("middle") ring has simply the rotational inertia about its center of origin:

\begin{equation}
    \frac{1}{5}MR^2
\end{equation}

And therefore, the total rotational inertia is:

\begin{equation}
    I = \frac{21}{5}MR^2
\end{equation}

* Spinning Top

** Torque
We are asked to find the magnitude and direction of torque $\vec{\tau}_0$ applied by the string. This is easily achieved with the expression for torque $\vec{r} \times \vec{F_0}$.

We will do this in components. Observing the point at which the string is attached, we noticed that it has two components: one towards the positive $y$ direction, and one towards the positive $z$ direction. That:

\begin{equation}
    \vec{r} = R\hat{j} + H\hat{k}
\end{equation}

Furthermore, we can see from the graph that $\vec{F_0} = F_0 \hat{i}$. Their dot products, therefore, are:

\begin{align}
    \vec{\tau}_0 &= (R\hat{j} + H\hat{k})\times (F_0 \hat{i})\\
&= RF_0 (\hat{j} \times \hat{i}) + HF_0 (\hat{k}\times \hat{i})\\
&= -RF_0 \hat{k} + HF_0 \hat{j}\\
&=  HF_0 \hat{j}-RF_0 \hat{k}
\end{align}

And therefore:

\begin{equation}
\begin{cases}
    \tau_0_x = 0\\
    \tau_0_y = HF_0\\
    \tau_0_z = -RF_0\\
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

** Balancing Forces
To figure the net torque on the system, we will need to add the torques contributing to the net torque in the system.

We have already deducted above $\vec{\tau}_0 = HF_0 \hat{j}-RF_0 \hat{k}$. Given $\vec{F}_1$ is attached to the origin of the system, it contributes no torque. Therefore, to figure out the net torque we only need to deduct that for $\vec{F_2}$.

\begin{align}
\vec{\tau}_2 &= \vec{r_2} \times \vec{F_2}\\
&=  -\frac{H}{2} \hat{k} \times F_2 \hat{i}\\
&=  -\frac{HF_2}{2} \hat{j}
\end{align}

As we know, the object simply rotates about the $\hat{k}$ axis. Therefore, the net torque along $\hat{j}$ would have to be zero.

Therefore:

\begin{equation}
-\frac{HF_2}{2} +HF_0  = 0
\end{equation}

We further understand that the object does not move. This means that it has a net force of $0$ as well. That is:

\begin{equation}
    F_0 + F_2 - F_1 = 0
\end{equation}

We are given $F_0$. We therefore have two equations for two variables, rendering it suitable for solving. 

\begin{align}
&-\frac{HF_2}{2} +HF_0  = 0\\
\Rightarrow\  & 2HF_0-HF_2 = 0\\
\Rightarrow\  & 2F_0-F_2 = 0\\
\Rightarrow\  & F_2 = 2F_0\\
&F_0+F_2-F_1 = 0\\
\Rightarrow\  & F_0+2F_0 - F_1 = 0\\
\Rightarrow\  & F_1 = 3F_0
\end{align}

Per the setup of the problem, $\vec{F_1}$ is in the $-\hat{i}$ direction, and $\vec{F}_2$ in the $\hat{i}$ direction. Hence:

\begin{equation}
    \begin{cases}
    \vec{F_1} = -3F_0 \hat{i} \\
    \vec{F_2} = 2F_0 \hat{i}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

** Rotational Inertia
We have already determined the net torque of the system.

\begin{align}
\vec{\tau}_2 &= -\frac{HF_2}{2} \hat{j}\\
\vec{\tau}_0 &= HF_0 \hat{j}-RF_0 \hat{k}\\
\vec{\tau}_{net} &= (HF_0 - \frac{HF_2}{2})\hat{j} -RF_0 \hat{k} 
\end{align}

We also know from the setup of the problem that the left term works out such that, given the values of $F_0$ and $F_2$, it is zero in this scenario. Hence:

\begin{equation}
\vec{\tau}_{net} = -RF_0 \hat{k} 
\end{equation}

Based on Newton's Second Law, we understand that:

\begin{equation}
    \vec{\tau}_{net} = I \vec{\alpha}
\end{equation}

If the top has rotational inertia $I_0$, therefore:

\begin{align}
  &I_0 \vec{\alpha_0} = -RF_0 \vec{k}\\
\Rightarrow\ &\vec{\alpha_0} = \frac{-RF_0}{I_0}\vec{k}
\end{align}

** Kinematics Equations
Our system is angularity accelerating at an constant angular acceleration of $\vec{\alpha_0}$. As such, we integrate twice to figure the kinematics equations.

First, as derived above:

\begin{equation}
   \vec{\alpha}(t) = \frac{-RF_0}{I_0}\vec{k}
\end{equation}

Taking the first integral of this expression, we get that:

\begin{equation}
   \vec{\omega}(t) = \int \vec{\alpha}(t) dt = \frac{-RF_0}{I_0}t\vec{k} + C
\end{equation}

where, as $\omega=0$ at $t=0$: 

\begin{equation}
   \vec{\omega}(t) = \frac{-RF_0}{I_0}t\vec{k}
\end{equation}

Performing the integral yet again, we have that:

\begin{equation}
   \vec{\theta}(t) = \int \vec{\omega}(t) dt =  \frac{-RF_0}{2I_0}t^2\vec{k}+C
\end{equation}

where again, as $\theta=0$ at $t=0$: 

\begin{equation}
   \vec{\theta}(t) =  \frac{-RF_0}{2I_0}t^2\vec{k}
\end{equation}

* Rectangular Rod
To find the rotational inertia of a rectangular rod, we need to perform three integrations: building up strips, slices, and finally the inertia of the actual rod.

** Strip
We begin by recalling that the expression for rotational inertia is:

\begin{equation}
   I = \sum_i m_i {l_i}^2
\end{equation}

Furthermore, we understand the mass of our entire volume is $M$. Therefore, the mass density along the object would be $\frac{M}{HWL}$.

To figure the inertia of an infinitesimal strip of point masses, we perform a simple integration along the $w$ axis:

\begin{align}
   I_{strip} &= \int_{-W/2}^{W/2} {l}^2 dm\\
   &= \int_{-W/2}^{W/2} {l}^2 \frac{dm}{dl} dl\\
   &= \int_{-W/2}^{W/2} {l}^2 \frac{M}{HWL} dl\\
   &= \frac{M}{HWL}\left(\frac{(W/2)^3}{3}-\frac{(-W/2)^3}{3}\right)\\
   &= \frac{M}{HWL}\left(\frac{W^3}{24}-\frac{-W^3}{24}\right)\\
   &= \frac{M}{HWL}\left(\frac{W^3}{12}\right)\\
   &= \frac{M}{HL}\left(\frac{W^2}{12}\right)
\end{align}

** Slice
We will now find the inertia of a slice. The procedure is essentially the same, but that there is no longer any non-constant components. Therefore, the inertias, as we are rotating about the same axis of a rigid body together, simply stack ("add"). That is: the rotational inertia of a slice is simply $H$ times that of a strip.

\begin{align}
    I_{slice} &= H\ I_{strip}\\
&= H\ \frac{M}{HL}\left(\frac{W^2}{12}\right)\\
&= \frac{M}{L}\left(\frac{W^2}{12}\right)
\end{align}

** Final Rotational Inertia
Finally, we will leverage the parallel axis theorem to deduct rotational inertia of the entire rod.

At every plate $i$, we note that it will be $l_i$ away from the axis of rotation $\hat{k}$. By the parallel axis theorem:

\begin{equation}
   I = I_{cm} + mD^2
\end{equation}

where, $l_i = D$ and $m=\frac{M}{L}$---the mass of each slice.

That is, then:

\begin{equation}
   I_{slice\ about\ \hat{k}} = \frac{M}{L}\left(\frac{W^2}{12}\right) + m_i (l_i)^2
\end{equation}

We aim to find the sum of all such rotational inertia slices about $\vec{k}$ along $L$, meaning we will figure:

\begin{equation}
   I= \sum_L\left( \frac{M}{L}\left(\frac{W^2}{12}\right) + m_i (l_i)^2\right)
\end{equation}

Splitting this summation into two parts:

\begin{equation}
   I = \sum_L \frac{M}{L}\left(\frac{W^2}{12}\right) + \sum_L m_i (l_i)^2
\end{equation}

We can see that, because the lack of differentials on the left side, the left expression can simply be simplified to route multiplication:

\begin{align}
   I &= \sum_L \frac{M}{L}\left(\frac{W^2}{12}\right) + \sum_L m_i (l_i)^2\\
&= M\left(\frac{W^2}{12}\right) + \sum_L m_i (l_i)^2
\end{align}

The right side, however, requires integration. The actual integral is, fortunately, almost the same procedure as before---summing up differential $l_i$ along $L$ via differential masses $m_i$. We will leverage the mass density of a slice again: $\frac{M}{L}$ ("total mass divided by all slices").

\begin{align}
    \sum_L m_i (l_i)^2 &= \int_{-L/2}^{L/2} l^2 dm\\
&= \int_{-L/2}^{L/2} l^2 \frac{dm}{dl}{dl}\\
&= \int_{-L/2}^{L/2} l^2 \frac{M}{L}{dl}\\
&= \frac{M}{L}\int_{-L/2}^{L/2} l^2 {dl}\\
&= \frac{M}{L}\int_{-L/2}^{L/2} l^2 {dl}\\
&= \frac{M}{L} \left (\left\frac{l^3}{3}\right |_{-L/2}^{L/2} \right)\\
&= \frac{M}{L} \left(\frac{L^3}{12}\right)\\
&= M \left(\frac{L^2}{12}\right)
\end{align}

Substituting this back into our above expression for $I$ again:

\begin{align}
    I &= M\left(\frac{W^2}{12}\right) + \sum_L m_i (l_i)^2\\
&= M\left(\frac{W^2}{12}\right) + M \left(\frac{L^2}{12}\right)\\
&= \frac{1}{12}M\left(W^2 + L^2\right)\ \blacksquare
\end{align}
