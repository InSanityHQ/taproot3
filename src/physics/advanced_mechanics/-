* Problem 1
The circumference of the circle: $\pi R^2$. To travel this circumference, it will mean traveling all of $2\pi$ under the speed of $\omega$, which means it will take $\frac{2\pi}{\omega}$.

Finally, therefore, the tangential velocity will require traveling $\pi R^2$ in $\frac{2\pi}{\omega}$:

\begin{equation}
   V = \pi R^2 \div \frac{2\pi}{\omega}  = \frac{\omega \pi R^2}{2\pi} = \frac{\omega R^2}{2} 
\end{equation}

And finally, in order to calculate angular momentum:

\begin{equation}
   \vec{L}(t) = \vec{r} \times m \vec{V_0}
\end{equation}

We will find the magnitude of this expression first:

\begin{align}
   |\vec{L}| &= |\vec{r}||m\vec{v_0}|sin\theta\\
&= Rm \frac{\omega R^2}{2} sin(\frac{\pi}{2})\\
&= \frac{m\omega R^3}{2} 
\end{align}

Furthermore, by the right hand rule, we can see that the direction of $\vec{L}$ is out of the page given the drawn figure.

* Problem 2
If a ball is traveling through space with no net force, given Newton's first law, it will travel linearly with velocity $\vec{v_0}$ at the direction thereof.

We can model this by the following figure:

We can see that if we define a coordinate system parallel to the direction of travel, we can have each $\sin(\theta) \vec{R_0}$ be equal to each other throughout the travel.

Therefore:

\begin{align}
   \vec{L}(t) &= \vec{r} \cross m\vec{V_0}\\
&= |\vec{r}||m\vec{v_0}|sin\theta\\
&= |\vec{r}|sin\theta|m\vec{v_0}|
\end{align}

We see that though $sin\theta$ and $\vec{r}$ are the two non-constant terms in the expression
