For the sake of simplicity I will assume that the stick has 0 width, meaning that it effectively acts as a line.
* Problem 1)
We know that kinetic energy is conserved, so we know that $\Delta KE = 0$.
As such, we know the following:

\begin{aligned}
KE_{ball;0} + KE_{stick;0} &= KE_{ball;f} + KE_{stick;f} \\
\end{aligned}

We know that the stick is initially at rest, and the ball is moving with velocity $v_{0}$. In addition, after the collision the ball has velocity $v_{f}$ and the stick COM has a velocity of $v_{CM}$ and the stick has angular velocity of $\omega$.

Then, our equation becomes

\begin{aligned}
(\frac{1}{2}m_{1}v_{0}^2) + (0) &= (\frac{1}{2}m_{1}v_{f}^2) + (\frac{1}{2}m_{2}v_{CM}^2 + \frac{1}{2}I_{0}\omega^2) \\
\end{aligned}

In addition, linear momentum is also conserved. That is, $\Delta P &= 0$. We know that angular velocity has no effect on linear momentum.
Therefore, the following equation holds true:

\begin{aligned}
P_{ball;0} + P_{stick;0} &= P_{ball;f} + P_{stick;f} \\
(m_{1}v_{0}) + (0) &= (m_{1}v_{f}) + (m_{2}v_{CM}) \\
m_{1}(v_{0} - v_{f}) = m_{2}v_{CM} \\
v_{0} - v_{f} &= \frac{m_{2}}{m_{1}}v_{CM} \\
v_{f} &= v_{0} - \frac{m_{2}}{m_{1}}v_{CM} \\
\end{aligned}

We have three unknowns: $v_{f}$, $v_{CM}$, and $\omega$.
