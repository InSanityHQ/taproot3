Using Energy Approach:
** Finding $v_{f}$
We know that the object starts at height $h$ and eventually ends up at the bottom of the ramp, i.e. height $0$.
We know that in this case, $\Delta PE &= -\Delta KE$. We know the initial height, and we know that it is initially stationary. We know that at the bottom of the ramp, the height is 0 and we know that it has a velocity. As such, we know that the following is true:

\begin{aligned}
\Delta PE &= -\Delta KE \\
PE_{i} - PE_{f} &= KE_{f} - KE_{i} \\
(mgh) - (0) &= \left(\frac{1}{2}mv_{f}^2 +\frac{1}{2}I_{0}\omega_{f}^2\right) - (0) \\
mgh &= \frac{1}{2}mv_{f}^2 + \frac{1}{2}I_{0}\omega_{f}^2\\
2mgh &= mv_{f}^2 + I_{0}\omega_{f}^2 \\
\end{aligned}
