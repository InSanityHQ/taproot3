* Givens
- With $v_o$ being the initial velocity of the projectile as a vector;
- With $v_x$ and $v_y$ being the x and y components of the initial velocity vector of the projectile;
- With $v_1$ being the initial downwards velocity of the target;
- With $x_o$ and $h_o$ being the initial horizontal distance between the projectile and target, and the initial height of the target, repectively;
* Proof
\begin{cases}
h_{projectile}(t) &= v_{y}t - \frac{1}{2}gt^2 \\
h_{object}(t) &= h_o - v_{1}t - \frac{1}{2}gt^2 \\
\end{cases}

Because we want to know the time ($t$) when $h_{projectile}$ and $h_{object}$ are equal, we will set them equal and get a good equation:

\begin{aligned}
v_{y}t - \frac{1}{2}gt^2 &= h_o + v_{1}t - \frac{1}{2}gt^2 \\
v_{y}t &= h_o + v_{1}t \\
\end{aligned}

Now that we have a nice equation, we can also solve for $t$. We will do this by using the $x(t)$ equation:

\begin{aligned}
x_o &= v_{x}t \\
t &= \frac{x_o}{v_{x}} \\
\end{aligned}

We can plug $t$ into our $v_y$ equation now:

\begin{aligned}
v_{y}\frac{x_o}{v_x} &= h_o + v_{1}\frac{x_o}{v_x} \\
x_{o}\frac{||v_o|| \sin{\theta}}{||v_o|| \cos{\theta}} &= h_o + \frac{v_{1}x_{o}}{||v_o|| \cos{\theta}} \\
\end{aligned}
