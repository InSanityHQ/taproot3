How do rockets work? They work by Newton's Third Law. Force applied over time gives you impulse, which is momentum.

* Setting Up
We will generally have a bunch of mass, and to get ahead you are throwing mass out the bottom of the rocket

The momentum ($V_e m$) that you lost is then propelling the rocket forwards.
