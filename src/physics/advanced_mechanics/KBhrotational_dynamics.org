#+title: Rotational Dynamics
#+author: Houjun Liu

Here comes the long awaited lecture on rotational dynamics.

* Torque
Ok at this point most of us know what torque is: it is the /force/ that causes rotation without any translation. It is "force" in the rotational sense.

For translational motion, we know that the defining Newton's Second Law expression is:

\begin{equation}
   \vec{F_{net}} = M\vec{a} 
\end{equation}

A similar thing works for torque:

\begin{equation}
   \vec{\tau_{net}} = I\vec{\alpha} 
\end{equation}

where $I$ is the rotational inertia and $\vec{\alpha}}$ would be the angular acceleration. This is actually not that entirely true, it only applies in limited cases where we are estimating a rigid body in circular motion.

** Rotational Inertia
For a simple particle going in circular motion, we know that:

\begin{equation}
I = Mr^2    
\end{equation}

that the rotational inertia is equal to the mass multiplied by the radius. We can see that inertia depends on the object about which things are rotating.

** Fixing origin
It is much easier to solve for rotation about a fixed origin. Therefore, for the expression we describe as something $r \times \vec{F}$, this $r$ is really necessarily about a fixed origin.

** Torque is Porp. to Force Applied
\begin{equation}
   |\vec{\tau}| \varpropto |\vec{F}|^\gamma
\end{equation}

We believe that the magnitude of torque should be proportional to the force applied. Why?

The circumference changes at every step can be measured that:

\begin{equation}
   R\Delta \theta = \Delta S 
\end{equation}

if we take the second derivative on both sides:

\begin{equation}
   R \frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2} = a = R \ddot{\theta}
\end{equation}

We can see angular acceleration is proportional to the vertical acceleration, which is proportional to the force. Therefore, torque is porp. to force applied.
