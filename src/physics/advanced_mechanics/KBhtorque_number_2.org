* Problem 1
The circumference of the circle: $2\pi R$. To travel this circumference, it will mean traveling all of $2\pi$ under the speed of $\omega$, which means it will take $\frac{2\pi}{\omega}$.

Finally, therefore, the tangential velocity will require traveling $2 \pi R$ in $\frac{2\pi}{\omega}$:

\begin{equation}
   V = 2\pi R \div \frac{2\pi}{\omega}  = \frac{2\omega \pi R}{2\pi} = \omega R 
\end{equation}

And finally, in order to calculate angular momentum:

\begin{equation}
   \vec{L}(t) = \vec{r} \times m \vec{V}_0
\end{equation}

We will find the magnitude of this expression first:

\begin{align}
   |\vec{L}| &= |\vec{r}||m\vec{v_0}|\sin\theta\\
&= Rm \omega R \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)\\
&= m\omega R^2 
\end{align}

Furthermore, by the right hand rule, we can see that the direction of $\vec{L}$ is out of the page given the drawn figure.

* Problem 2
If a ball is traveling through space with no net force, given Newton's first law, it will travel linearly with velocity $\vec{v}_0$ at the direction thereof.

We can model this by the following figure:

We can see that if we define a coordinate system parallel to the direction of travel, we can have each $\sin(\theta) \vec{R_0}$ be equal to each other throughout the travel.

Therefore:
\begin{align} \vec{L}(t) &= \vec{r} \cross m\vec{V_0}\\ &= |\vec{r}||m\vec{v_0}|\sin\theta\\ &= |\vec{r}|\sin\theta|m\vec{v}_0|
\end{align}

We see that though $\sin\theta$ and $\vec{r}$ are the two non-constant terms in the expression, the projection of $\vec{r} \sin\theta$ would be equal if we are leveraging the equality as given above would stay constant as per the figure above because the $y$ coordinate for every position is the same in our coordinate system (and hence the $y$ projection would be the same). 

Therefore, all elements of $\vec{L}(t)$ is constant---making the overall angular momentum constant.

* Problem 3

Proof:

\begin{equation}
   \vec{\tau}_{net} = \frac{d\vec{L}}{dt} 
\end{equation}

We are going to first take the expression for angular momentum:

\begin{equation}
   \vec{L}(t) = \vec{r} \times m \vec{V}
\end{equation}

And, as per prescribed to the right, take its derivative:

\begin{align}
   \frac{d\vec{L}}{dt} &= \frac{d}{dt} (\vec{r} \times m\vec{V}) \\
&=\frac{d}{dt} (\vec{r} \times m\vec{V}) \\
&= \left(\frac{d\vec{r}}{dt} \times m\frac{d\vec{r}}{dt}\right) + \left(\vec{r} \times m\frac{d\vec{V}}{dt}\right)\\
&= 0 + \left(\vec{r} \times m\frac{d\vec{V}}{dt}\right)\\
&= \left(\vec{r} \times m\frac{d\vec{V}}{dt}\right)\\
&= \vec{r} \times m\frac{d\vec{V}}{dt}
\end{align}

The only technique we took here is simply the cross-product product rule.

Lastly, therefore, we know that the first derivative of velocity is acceleration. Hence:

\begin{align}
   \frac{d\vec{L}}{dt} &= \frac{d}{dt} (\vec{r} \times m\vec{V}) \\
&= \vec{r} \times m\frac{d\vec{V}}{dt}\\
&= \vec{r} \times m\vec{a}\\
&= \vec{r} \times \vec{F}
\end{align}

Of course, $\vec{\tau}_{net} = \vec{r}\times\vec{F}_{net}$. Hence:

\begin{equation}
   \vec{\tau}_{net} = \frac{d\vec{L}}{dt} \ \blacksquare
\end{equation}
