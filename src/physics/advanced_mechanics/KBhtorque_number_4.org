# Why are we numbering these psets, anyways?

* Notes from Within the Lecture
\begin{equation}
    CM = \frac{\sum m_i \vec{r_i}}{\sum m_i} = \frac{1}{M} \sum m_i \vec{r}_i
\end{equation}

i.e.: the centre of mass is the weighted average of the centers. "First moment."

\begin{equation}
   I = M \frac{\sum m_i {r_i}^2}{M}=\sum m_i {r_i}^2
\end{equation}

i.e.: the rotational inertia is $M$ times the weighted average, squared. "Second moment."

- 1st moment: Mean
- 2nd moment: Standard Deviation
- 3rd moment: Skew
- 4th moment: Kurtosis

If I take an axis, and shift the direction of the axis, we can compute the rotational inertia about the center of mass and then move it
