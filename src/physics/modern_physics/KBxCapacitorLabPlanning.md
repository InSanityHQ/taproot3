# The capacitor lab!



for a single C:
two diff Rs,
and two diff $V_{bat}$


curve fitting equations:

$I = I_0 \cdot \frac{-t}{e^{RC}}$

$v_c(t) = V_b(1-e^{ \frac{-t}{RC}})$

number of Coulombs that flowed is the same as the area under the curve of I/T
sampling of 1k/S,

if a nice 0: 
add up at every instance? 

we will get a checklist of things that go into the report.
gonna be a lot of graphs! don't put em all in


$\frac{1}{3}$


$I(t) = I_0e^{-\frac{t-t_0}{\tau}}$
