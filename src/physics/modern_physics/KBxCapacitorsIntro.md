# so, capacitors.

```ad-question
is there a charge on the terminals of the battery?
```

yes! but not much. very small surface areas, very far away from eachother


### **why resistors?**
used to control things, and components behave like resistors

### what doesnt behave like resistors?
batterys, diodes, motors? ect.
and capacitors, but those don't exist yet


```ad-def
title: capacitors
something designed to store a significant amount of charge
```
how do you do this? spread it over a big surface area


represeted as two equal len lines

surface area comes from it being wrapped

net charge is zero! but it stores charge because the charges are separated
kinda like a very small battery

**capacitors are not like a bucket**. they are like a water balloon, in the sense that the more voltage you put across it, the more charge flows
until it pops, of course

```ad-important
C: capacitance
$C = \frac{Q}{V}$
```
coulomb per volt is a *Farad* after Faraday
Q is on positive side

$C=\kappa \epsilon_0  \frac{A}{d}$

A = area of each plate
d = separation between plates
$\epsilon_0$ = some constant, $8.85 * 10^{-12}$
$\kappa$ = dielectric constant of the material between the plates
for air, it's 1. else, for insulators it's between 2 - 4

if you have a material which can get polarized, like the paper we had early on, then it will draw addition opposite charges!
and now the charge is a lil bigger then when u just had air

**that extra charge is the $\kappa$**!
typically 1-4.


```ad-def
title: dialtectic
insulator that polzarisis
```

turns out, most capacitors are not symetrical! can't connect an arbitrary side


LED: longer goes to positive
