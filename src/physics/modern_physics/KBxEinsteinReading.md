# Einstein!

axioms are true, and things derived from axioms are true ("true")
if we mirror reality, then we can judge truth by what is (ruler and compass)
- but this "truth" is limited!
	- as revealed through general relativity
- every scene, event, or object in space is relative to a point on a rigid body
	- required to be on the surface of rigid bodies
	- dependent on the existence of points that are distinguishable
	-  we can surpass these limitations!
-  by doing this:
	- modify the reference rigid body such that it reached the target object
	- use a number for length instead of predefined points of reference
	- we don't need to actully modify the original rigid body.
- aka, cartesian coords!

> "the purpose of mechanics is to describe how bodies change their position in space with time."

wrong! according to einstein

standing on a train, drop a stone, does it fall in a straight line or a parabolic curve "in reality"?
thus, what is space and time? hence, the def above sucks.

instead, we get "motion relative to a practically rigid body of reference"
we also have to deal with time, as defined by clocks located in each reference frame

## chapter 4 and on, later
inclass!
the law of inertia: a body w/o gravitational influence or will either stay in uniform motion or be at rest
we can only use this in the galilein system



inertial reference frames w/o rotation can inherent laws from eachother




## starting, again

- W = v + w, where W is relative velocity and v, w are the individual velocites
	- this equations **does not work!** for reasons which, we are about to learn.
	- but we are gonna assume it is correct

### the apparent incompatibility of the law of propagation of light with the principle of relativity

- we know that the velocity of light cannot depend on the velocity of the emmiter
	- else, we can get things that travel faster than light
- also, diff speeds for different wavelenghts?
- same equation as above, w/ same direction traveling :: `w=c-v`
	- but if we are in diff directions... 
- but we dont actully need to cull one of the laws that contradict, we just need to do use **special relativity**
