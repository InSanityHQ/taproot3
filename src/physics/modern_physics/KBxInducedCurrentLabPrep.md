# Induced current lab 

[the data](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1E7C8wz52qIuD1tmbRtHDO9l-Not5ELo7)

## Analysis
#### ex 1

This experiment consisted of moving a magnet with the north side pointed down horizontally over a coil of wire connected to a current sensor. Current is induced by the moving magnet and the changing magnetic flux it causes. Since the magnet is moving horizontally over the coil, the flux (and therefore the magnitude of the current) will increase until the magnet passes the center, when it will start decreasing. The sign or direction of the current will also flip once the magnet passes the center. The predicted graph I drew looked like: Which was reasonably similar to the experimental data.

$B= \frac{\mu_0 I}{2 \pi r}$
where $\mu_0=4 \pi \cdot 10^{-7} Tm/A$
$r = 1/2 in$ THIS MIGHT BE WRONG

percent error calculation
$\delta = \left| \frac{v_A - v_E}{v_E} \right| \cdot 100\%$

no measured current, so instead we take the ratio of the two $\frac{\mu_0}{2\pi r}$s, and then compare to the ratio of measured B.
