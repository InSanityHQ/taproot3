# Current! and magnetism!

**flux:** analogy, total number of field lines poking out of a surface

```ad-important
area A and it is perpendicular to B, the flux is 
$$\phi = BA \cos(\theta)$$
```
if the area is tilted, we have lower flux. this makes sense, as really we are just taking the dot product from the normal to the surface.

**change in flux** is what induces current.


EMF :: eletromotive force. it is the rate of change of the flux w.r.t. time
$$EMF = \frac{d\phi}{dt}$$

flux can be changed by ::
- mag field strength 
- total area of loop
- area of the loop that is crossed by the field
- angle of the loop w.r.t. the field
- or, ofc, combos.
the pictures! they match! like this: 

A-B
C-D
B-A
D-C

## the experiment notes, for after break.


moving magnet across coil of wire.

figure out the induced current over time

tenth of an amp.

moving the graph gives us,
