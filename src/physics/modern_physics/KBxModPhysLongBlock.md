on non-uclidian geomomatrey, you can have a circle whose radius is longer than the circumfrance / 2pi
if the radius is longer, we call this "positive curvature"
if it's less, we call it "negative curvature"

we have to imagine projecting a 3d sphere into four dimensions
so our surface area is not $4\pi r^{2}$
