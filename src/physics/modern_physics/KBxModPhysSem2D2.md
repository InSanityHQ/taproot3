arbitrarily, define the slope of 1 to be the speed of light
- speed of light: 3 * 10^8 m/s, 
	- or 30k km/s
	- actully, its 2.998, not 3, but who cares! "it's 3." says barak
	
- events are instantaneous! eg. lightning striking

- light cant go faster, so everything breaks! this is what it's all about.
