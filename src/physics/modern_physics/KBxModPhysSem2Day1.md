# Semester 2, day one!

"we are made of start stuff"
- the way the universe understands itself? #cool

intros! sick.

we are gonna go into: 
- relativity
	- special relativity,
	- general relativity
- spacetime and such
- nuclear phys
- quantum
	- atomic theory
	- the standard model
	- quantum gravity 
- then, dark matter and such!
physic@nueva!

but, we are gonna start at **special relativity** 
the intro was, [[KBxSpecialRelativityIntro]]
this is a special case, when the reference frames are not accelerating 

`u` is defining a frame of reference, where `v` is the velocity of something she is watching?
monica is x

we can draw the t' axis, which is the primed frame of reference
slope is 1/u!
the point is, as she slides along the line, she will always stay at x=0.

x determines t=0

x axis stays constant w/ x'

## equations
$x' = x - ut$
$t'=t$
$v' = v - u$
only if the reference frames intersect at $t=0$!
