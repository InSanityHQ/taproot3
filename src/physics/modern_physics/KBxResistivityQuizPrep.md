title: the quiz

Quiz in class on Monday 10/4. You may bring a single 3"x5" index card with notes on both large sides. You should _not_ bring a table of resistivities. Be able to apply the resistance equation (relationship involving length area etc.), and analyze voltage, current, power, in DC circuits with a network of resistors. And apply Kirchoff's laws directly to find voltage, current, etc. in circuits containing 2 or more batteries.
