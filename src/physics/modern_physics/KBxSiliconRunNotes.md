# Silicon Run!

[the video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XTWXRj24GM)

about integrated circuits

transistors! they are the heart of the chip?

transistors can store info or execute

starts by: 
growing pure silicon
from sand? 
they insert a seed, then because it is a crystal, it forms more of the seed with the same structure


impurities: dopants


they use arsenic?

48 hours to grow a single crystal

they are: 
semiconductors!

- process things
	- polish and stuff
	- measure resistivity
	- glass is etched which then ethces onto the silicon wafer
	
- transitors turn on and off hundreds of millions of times per second!

### C-MOS
- two n-type regions seperated by p-type substrate 
	- two regions are called source and drain
	- these form an **eletronic switch**
- gate electrode is isolated from p-type 
	- gate is positively charged, atracting electrons from the n-type regions?
	- this closed the switch
	- vise versa also operates
	
- can have both versa and vise on one switched! 
	-  called, complimentery MOS
	- current turns one on and one off

- isolated via silicon dioxie


### the fab process
- need to control contamination! 
- four basis techniqes: 
	- formation of silicon dioxide
	- doping 
	- deposition
	- precision patterning
- clean the wafers
	- grows silicon dioxide layer
		- the layer is used as a stencil to dope certain regions
- adds a layer of "resist"?
- negative resist can either get removed or stay when exposed to light?
- then, dry ethihc with plasma
- built layer at a time
- bombards wafers with dopant ions! they are driven into the wafers
- the coating blocks the regions from getting doped
- adds oxide which insulates the layers from eachother so there isnt any eletric field leaking
- poly-silicon acts as the gates
- and then add the source and drain region
- enealed! fixed!
- coated in glass??
- holes for wire connections
- tunsten over it
- and then a bunch of wiring?
- and then it's over!
