# lets find out

- it's cus of the moons formation?

- venus and earth:
	- similar composition and size
	- but venus doesnt have a magnetic field!

- magnetic field needs a moving liquid core
	- people thought that this was the reason for the lack of magnetic field but it's not
	
- people think it's about no convection
	- stable lables prevent the convection needed to generate the field
- on earth the moon disrupted, mixing the elements throughout the earth 
	- this means they can't form the stable homogenous layers
