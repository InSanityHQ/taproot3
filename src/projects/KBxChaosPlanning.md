# chaos! let's do it.

- similar
	- http://www.malinc.se/m/Lorenz.php, interactive, but bad
	- https://marksmath.org/visualization/LorenzExperiment/ beautiful 3d integration with 2d
	- https://itp.uni-frankfurt.de/~gros/Vorlesungen/SO/simulation_example/ code!
	
- parsing
	- [writing](http://mathquill.com)
	- [parsing](https://arthanzel.github.io/evaluatex/)
	- could, ofc, write my own math parser. could be fun, but also vulberabelt to xss



### main idea
- beautiful exploration of many different chaotic systems, starting ofc with lorenz.
- can be used as cool background things like @exr0ns meshwave,
- but also people can enter their own equations or choose from a bank of equations and modify values

- colors! pretty! 2d, flat. don't think i want 3d exploration, even though i want 3d equations.

### features!


### tech
- parsers, from above
- canvas, and 2d rendering of 3d points based on the simple perspective / size thing.
