## things that need work
- navigating | index only search?
- creating new notes (a hassle)
- naming conventions 
- being able to start and end sections? not just start
- linking to org files

## general ideas
- easily graphing functions?
- sectioning with `</end section>` component
- daily org â†’ md conversion
- style links, cus rn they look kinda like trash. take inspo from https://mochi.cards links

## possibilities
react components! + custom dict in various complements for easy insert

## to configure
