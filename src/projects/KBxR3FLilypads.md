# Lilypads!


## some models
- https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/lilypads-b6b580153d27457f99a999a82f3efd60
	- just lily pad, nice and geometric
- https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/froggy-pie-by-lemonscribs-41e0a74b920f4934ade4e420ee1cd48c
	- really cool backface-culling model


## ready to
try to export some models, see if the textures maintain. if so, try to load into three js / use as a particle system!

### features
- display lilypads
- move with mouse force
- drift back to right position
- bookmarking!


## ending

the final [website](https://lilypads.sanity.gq)!

### reflections

grain postprocessing was cool!
coudnt get bloom working.. might be due to how the model works

raycasting! it is good!
drei example docs are a lil hard to use
search for `tailwind x` where x is a component yields good results
feel a lot more comfortable with complex callback and function passing between functional react
also, local storage is very easy to use.

and, ask other for what they think! people have a lot of good feedback and ideas for heavy exploration based projects like these.
