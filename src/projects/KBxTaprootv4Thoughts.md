## cool digital gardens
- https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners place to search for
- https://jzhao.xyz
	- really like the backlinks, node view
	- the art at the top, which corresponds to the tags (doesnt need to tho)
	- don't like how linear it is..
	- incredibly clean.
- https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes
	- note preview on hover!
	- see multiple notes at once
		- this leads to super low nav friction
- https://notes.tomcritchlow.com
	- not much good here... but i like the muted highlight
- https://maggieappleton.com/garden
	- interesting seperation of notes types, 
	- and sort w/ note stages (and **custom icons** for them)
