"one of the things i like to do a lot, is breathing. actully, i do it almost all the time, which is pretty cool, but anyways, i also like to do data viz. so i decided to combine these two things for my unessay."

"this is a visulization of some breathing exercises i did."

height at start represents 'depth' of breath, as measured by the integral of the normalized audio curve

fractions are the most 'impactful' breaths of the combined data, as defined by change in heartrate across the breath.
