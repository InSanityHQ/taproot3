#+TITLE: SOM 11 Index

* Foreword
What?! Jack is taking SOM notes??

Ok, so turns out that the modules thing of SOM actually lends itself to some cool readings from PubMed, so we might as well take some notes.

Also, I really want to try org-noter and don't want to disrupt my DevonTHINK workflow for something that matters.
